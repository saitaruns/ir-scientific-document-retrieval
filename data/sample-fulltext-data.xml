	<title>Response of the Dominant Alga Fucus gardneri (Silva) (Phaeophyceae) to the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill and Clean-up </title>
	<fulltext><segment>intertidal; marine ecology; oil spills; pollution effects; rockweed; seaweeds</segment><segment>Fucusgardneri (Silva) is the dominant alga in intertidal communities of wave protected coasts of the northeast Pacific Thom, 1983, Kendziorek and Stekoll, 1984, De Vogelaere and Foster, 1994 and Van Tamelen and Stekoll, 1996. Canopies formed by this perennial species provide food and shelter to a variety of intertidal and nearshore organisms, a role fundamental to the structure of the intertidal community. Injury to the F. gardneri population is likely to affect many other organisms within the intertidal and subtidal communities (Moore and Seed, 1986). For this reason many of our studies of damage and recovery focused on Fucus populations.</segment><segment>Studies that have examined the effects of oil spills or other major disturbances to intertidal algae have quantified only population parameters such as total biomass, percent cover, or total numbers of individuals (e.g. Foster et al., 1971, Thomas, 1977, Southward and Southward, 1978, Floc&apos;h and Diouris, 1980, Floc&apos;h and Diouris, 1981 and Rolan and Gallagher, 1991). None have investigated the physiological or morphological conditions of individual plants. Our study quantifies several F. gardneri attributes providing information on possible injury to individuals. Data were collected on F. gardneri morphology, reproductive potential, and epiphyte cover, providing a comprehensive profile and thorough assessment of injury to the F. gardneri population affected by the oil spill. The sampling plan of the study was designed so that results from the individual study sites could be extrapolated to the entire area of the Exxon Valdez oil spill.</segment><segment>Data for most F. gardneri attributes were from thalli collected by the Coastal Habitat Injury Assessment project, under the direction of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustees. Methods employed are described in detail in Highsmith et al., 1994 and Highsmith et al., 1996 and Stekoll et al. (1996). The entire area affected by the spill was divided into three regions: Prince William Sound (PWS), Cook Inlet-Kenai (CIK) and the Kodiak–Alaska Peninsula (KAP) regions Stekoll et al., 1996 and Sundberg et al., 1996. Habitats sampled in each of these regions consisted of sheltered rocky and coarse-textured sites. Estuarine sites were sampled in PWS and CIK. Exposed rocky habitats were sampled only in PWS because oiled sites in the CIK and KAP regions appeared to suffer little damage due to the greater wave exposures.</segment><segment>The non-oiled reference sites used for injury assessment studies differed significantly between the first year of study (1989) and subsequent years. In 1989 both the oiled and non-oiled sites were randomly selected from the total set of potential sites (Sundberg et al., 1996). However, this selection process produced a set of reference sites for the PWS region that was primarily situated in embayments on the mainland of the western side of the Sound. These embayments had larger freshwater sources than the island sites, resulting in lower salinities and more ice scour effects at the non-oiled sites. In 1990 the non-oiled reference sites were changed to an After Control-Impact Paired design (Stekoll et al., 1993) in which the oiled sites were paired with suitable reference stations based on physical parameters such as wave exposure, beach morphology, and offshore bathymetry. A description of sites, locations, experimental design, and sampling scheme was reported elsewhere Highsmith et al., 1994 and Stekoll et al., 1996.</segment><segment>Basic sampling involved collection of F. gardneri thalli along with all other erect macrophytes from randomly placed quadrats &lt;1 K)&quot; title=&quot;Full-size image (&lt;1 K)&quot; src=&quot;/sd/grey_pxl.gif&quot; data-inlimgeid=&quot;1-s2.0-S0025326X00000473-si2.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;1 K)&quot; title=&quot;Full-size image (&lt;1 K)&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0025326X00000473-si2.gif&quot;&gt; located in each of the three tidal levels on six transects per site. The tidal height zones were located at 0–1 m below mean higher water (MHW) as delimited by the Verrucaria zone (MVD 1), 1–2 m below MHW (MVD 2), and 2–3 m below MHW (MVD 3). The macrophytes were preserved in 5% formalin in seawater and transported back to the laboratory. Samples were collected on four dates during 1989–1991. Additional sampling trips for percent cover estimates were conducted from 1992 to 1994.</segment><segment>Specific data were collected from each F. gardneri thallus to quantify aspects of its morphology and to provide additional information on population dynamics. In the laboratory, data on the number of individual plants and thallus length and weight were recorded for F. gardneri thalli separated from the macrophyte quadrat samples. Additional data were collected on reproductive potential. An F. gardneri thallus was defined as reproductive if it had at least one receptacle. A receptacle was defined as a fertile area of the thallus (Bold and Wynne, 1985). A reproductive index was generated as a measure of the development of the receptacles on each thallus. Values ranged from 1 (no receptacles present) to 6 (conceptacles depleted and receptacles eroding). Preliminary site visit data showed that many thalli had physical erosion, some to the point of having no blades. We scored injury for each thallus as consisting of bare stipes or other, less severe, physical injury. Evidence of regrowth from injured tissues was scored as regeneration. Thalli were also scored for epiphyte coverage. Coverage by epiphytes was recorded on a scale from 1 (1–25% of the thallus covered) to 4 (76–100% of the thallus covered). The presence of sterile blade inflations was recorded for each thallus along with an index for blade inflations on a scale from 0 (no inflations) to 4 (76–100% inflations).</segment><segment>Data on percent cover of F. gardneri were collected from 80×50 cm quadrats using a 40- or 80-point contact technique (Stekoll et al., 1996). Percent cover data were collected in all regions and habitats during 1990 and 1991 and continued through 1994 for sheltered rocky habitats in PWS and CIK.</segment><segment>Egg viability was measured on individual thalli collected in the field during 1990. Random thalli were selected by collecting the nearest fertile F. gardneri thallus within a 1 m radius semicircle measured from the left side of each algal removal quadrat. The thalli were bagged for transport to the laboratory aboard the research ship where receptacles were selected for measuring egg release. At least six thalli were chosen per MVD at each site.</segment><segment>The largest and ripest receptacle was chosen from each thallus, washed with fresh water, blotted dry, and set in sterile seawater in a 50 ml plastic, square-sided bottle for 48 h at 8–10°C with a photoperiod of 16:8 L:D. The released eggs and zygotes were stained with `fluorescent brightener 28&apos; (calcofluor white, Sigma Chemical) and preserved in 5% formalin for enumeration by fluorescence microscopy.</segment><segment>Germination success was determined by scoring 100 randomly selected eggs/zygotes in each sample as unfertilized (no evident staining) or fertilized (stained with calcofluor). Embryo percentage was scored as the percent of fertilized eggs with more than one cell division.</segment><segment>Details of the experimental design and statistical approach for this study are in McDonald et al. (1995). Attributes estimating quadrat mean densities were analysed using a two-tailed t-test after testing for homogeneity of variances. Data were log transformed as necessary and if the variances were still not homogeneous by Levene&apos;s test (Milliken and Johnson, 1984), Satterwaite&apos;s correction was used in a regular two-sample t-test. Proportional data (percent cover, fertilization success and embryo percentage) were transformed using the arcsine square-root transformation (Steel and Torrie, 1980) before paired t-test comparisons were performed. For the analysis of variables measured on F. gardneri attributes expressed as ratios (e.g. relative abundance, percentage injured plants, average reproductive index, etc), two-sample randomization tests (Manly, 1991) were conducted to compare pairs of oiled and non-oiled sites.</segment><segment>Fisher’s procedure for combining results of independent tests (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981) was used with equal weights (importance values) on each oiled, non-oiled site pair to synthesize the results of the site-paired tests. Inferences from the Fisher procedure are limited to the specific set of site pairs in the study, following the logic that each site pair is a separate experiment with equal weight.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Standardization of the Preparation and Quantitation of Water-accommodated Fractions of Petroleum for Toxicity Testing </title>
	<fulltext><segment>toxicity tests; complex mixtures; oil; dispersants; dispersed oil; oil spills</segment><segment>Oil and its refined products are perhaps the most complex and variable mixtures to evaluate toxicologically. Many aspects of toxicity testing, traditionally stemming from the use of single, water-soluble compounds must be re-evaluated in the light of the literally thousands of compounds in crude oil. Given this complexity, it is not surprising that substantial variability exists in the collection, interpretation and use of acute toxicity data on the effects of crude oil, refined oil products, oilspill clean-up agents such as dispersants and mixtures of oil and dispersants on marine organisms in the literature to date (including reviews by Allen, 1984, Rice, 1985, Tjeerdema et al., 1989, NRC, 1989, Smalheer et al., 1992 and Markarian et al., 1995 among others). The wide variety of biological, chemical and analytical methods employed have produced a diverse collection of data which does not easily lend itself to cross-comparison. There is a little consistency across investigations in test medium preparation, species, test procedures and analytical verification, which is often absent altogether NRC, 1989 and Markarian et al., 1995. Even when these differences are put aside, consistent conclusions are not readily forthcoming. Further, methodological variability and lack of standardization bring data reproducibility into question.</segment><segment>It is generally accepted that the most recent formulations of dispersants represent minor acute toxicity concerns as compared to oil (NRC, 1989). A number of investigations have reported that dispersed oil elicits higher toxicity to marine organisms than oil or dispersants alone (e.g., Tarzwell, 1971, Verriopoulos and Moraitiou-Apostolopoulou, 1982 and Bobra et al., 1989); however, in some cases the dispersant alone appeared more toxic than either dispersed or undispersed oil (Unsal, 1991). Observed increased toxicity of dispersed oil (chemically or mechanically) has been attributed variously to particle size in the dispersion (Bobra et al., 1989), and to aromatic hydrocarbon content (especially mono- and diaromatics Anderson et al., 1987). In truth, however, acute oil toxicity is brought about by a number of interacting chemical, physical and physiological factors, and is highly dependent on the specific conditions of exposure.</segment><segment>Estimates of toxicity are relative, not absolute, and are dependent upon the test conditions and populations being exposed. Comparisons among species, life stages or toxicants are difficult, if not impossible, when there are significant differences in the methodologies used to produce data. Given the chemical complexity of oil, with potentially thousands of components having widely varying Henry’s Law behaviours, and the fact that mixing oil, water and dispersant creates a dynamic multi-phase system, it is not surprising that toxicity test results can be affected by a host of factors having to do with test conditions. Therefore, the standardization of as many test parameters as possible is of paramount importance.</segment><segment>One of the most fundamental parameters affecting any toxicity test is the exposure medium itself. Test media must be reproducible over time and between laboratories. Similarly, standardized analytical methods must be available for its characterization and quantitation. These methods should be based upon sound, up-to-date scientific practices and, ideally, be as simple and cost-effective as possible to ensure widespread use.</segment><segment>One significant shortcoming of much of the previously reported data comparing the effects of oil alone to that of dispersed oil is the lack of analytical verification of exposures. Analytical measurement of test media is critical when dealing with oil and dispersants because the primary function of dispersants is to increase the entry of oil into water, thus changing exposure. The use of median lethal loading (the amount of oil per volume of water that produces 50% mortality) has been broadly used to rank the toxicity of materials that are considered complex mixtures Girling, 1989 and Girling et al., 1992. However, from an environmental effect perspective, only the amount of a product that enters the water column has the potential to yield toxic effects on aquatic organisms. Thus, actual measured exposures must be evaluated in determining toxic concentrations, and in particular, when comparing different materials or preparations. In oil spills, as in most cases, both the amount of material that enters the water, as well as the duration of contact, must be considered when assessing potential effects of response options and environmental trade-offs.</segment><segment>To this end, a working group was formed several years ago composed of representatives from industry, academia and government from across North America (and later from Europe) dedicated to standardizing and improving the quality and usefulness of laboratory research on the aquatic effects of oil spill treating agents Kucklick, 1994 and Singer et al., 1995. This group, known as the Chemical Response to Oil Spills Ecological Effects Research Forum (CROSERF), has been working to assure that data generated are directly comparable among laboratories, and of the type usable in decision-making when oil enters the aquatic environment. Toxicity test aspects that were considered most in need of standardization for oil testing were preparation of test media, analytical measurement of test media and method of exposure.</segment><segment>Much of CROSERF’s early work was carried out in co-ordination with similar, but more narrowly focused, work undertaken by Environment Canada. The majority of the direct investigations reported here were carried out at the University of California and Exxon Biomedical Sciences. Since their specification, the protocols described here have been successfully implemented in laboratories at the University of Maryland, University of South Florida, Texas A&amp;M University and the University of Alaska.</segment><segment>Preparation of Water-accommodated Fractions (WAFs) of Oil Alone</segment><segment>For clarity, the CROSERF group has specified the technical definition of `water-accommodated fraction&apos; (WAF) as a laboratory-prepared medium derived from low energy (no vortex) mixing of a poorly soluble test material (e.g., an oil or petroleum product) which is essentially free of particles of bulk material Aurand and Coelho, 1996 and Coelho and Aurand, 1997. The term WAF, as opposed to `water-soluble fraction&apos; (WSF), is considered to be more technically correct because solutions do not undergo steps to ensure that all possible particulate whole oil has been removed, such as filtration or centrifugation Girling, 1989, Bennett et al., 1990 and Girling et al., 1992. Such steps would require physical handling of the medium, possibly introducing uncontrolled chemical loss or change. Therefore, even though the procedures described here produce a medium verifiably free of emulsified oil (i.e., a WSF, Anderson et al., 1974), we feel continued use of the term WAF is technically more appropriate.</segment><segment>Several factors are important for the consistent preparation of WAFs, including pretreatment of dilution water (filtration, sterilization, etc.), mixing energy and mixing duration. Systematic investigation of the influences of each of these on the resulting medium have led to the specification of several WAF preparation protocol parameters. The procedure described here represents a compromise that balances the desire to generate environmentally realistic test media with the need for media of highly repeatable composition.</segment><segment>The matrix used for all preparation aspects described here was natural seawater, of approximately 33 ppt salinity. We have no direct data on the influence of salinity on resultant WAFs. However, we do not anticipate that any significant operational changes in the herein presented protocols are necessary on the basis of salinity.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Hydrocarbons in Coastal Sediments of Patagonia, Argentina: Levels and Probable Sources </title>
	<fulltext><segment>superficial sediments; Patagonian coast; hydrocarbon levels; anthropogenic; biogenic; alkane indices</segment><segment>Oil production and transport are among the most important economic activities in Patagonia. However, these activities may result in large spills as a result of accidents and minor spills from transfer operations, bilge washing and elimination of ballast discharge. In addition, fishing vessels and cargo ships generate an important amount of hydrocarbon waste that may reach the coast affecting seabird and other marine organisms. Chronic pollution derived from these oil inputs affects the coastal and marine ecosystem and is necessary to study and quantify.</segment><segment>Oil activities on the Argentine coast include offshore exploitation platforms, loading buoys, and transport between ports in Patagonia (Cullén, Punta Loyola, Caleta Olivia, and Caleta Córdova) and those located in the northern Argentine coast (Bahı́a Blanca, La Plata, and Buenos Aires).</segment><segment>The goal of this study was to quantify the current levels of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons along the Patagonian coastal zone, determine their possible sources using n-alkane distribution indices and compare these results with previous information obtained in Patagonia.</segment><segment>The coasts of Patagonia extend throughout more than 2000 km between 40°S and 54°S. Samples were obtained at 15 locations (Fig. 1) located at river mouths, bays and gulfs. Punta Loyola, Caleta Olivia, Comodoro Rivadavia, and Caleta Córdova have charging petroleum ports. Punta Quilla, Puerto Rawson, Puerto Deseado, Bahı́a Camarones, Puerto Madryn, and San Antonio Oeste have important commercial fishing ports. Rı́o Negro and Rı́o Colorado are located at the mouth of important rivers.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Study area and sampling locations on Patagonian coastal zone.

At some locations, several stations were sampled. Superficial sediments were obtained at a depth of 0–3 and 3–6 cm in the intertidal area using plexiglass tubes of 25 cm length and 4.5 cm internal diameter, which were introduced vertically into the sediment. Gravel sediments were sampled using spatulas. In cases where sediment structure did not allow a stratified sampling, only samples from 0 to 3 cm were obtained. Sediments were transferred to glass containers and frozen to −20°C until analysed.</segment><segment>Extraction and fractionation of hydrocarbons</segment><segment>We followed the methods and recommendations suggested in UNESCO, 1982 and UNESCO, 1984 and Gold et al. (1987). Frozen sediments were dried at 40°C to constant weight, and 50 g of the dry material was digested under reflux with 100 ml of methanol and 3 g of KOH. The non-saponificable fraction was obtained by extracting twice with 25 ml of hexane. The combined extracts were dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate, and the volume was reduced to 2 ml by rotary evaporation and to 0.2 ml under soft flowing N2 gas at ambient temperature. The clean-up and isolation of hydrocarbon fractions were carried by column chromatography with totally activated alumina (activity grade I neutral). Elution with hexane gave a fraction consisting of aliphatic hydrocarbons while elution with hexane-dichlorometane yielded a fraction containing aromatic hydrocarbons. The aliphatic fraction was measured by high-resolution gas chromatography and the aromatic fraction by fluorescence.</segment><segment>Determination of aliphatic hydrocarbons through gas chromatography</segment><segment>High-resolution gas chromatography was conducted on a Konik 3000 gas chromatograph, equipped with a J &amp; W DB1 fused silica column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.), split/splitless capillary injection system, and a flame ionization detector (FID). The samples were analysed in the splitless mode using nitrogen as carrier gas, at a rate of 1 ml/min. The injector and detector temperatures were maintained at 250°C and 320°C, respectively. The column temperature was programmed from 60°C (2 min hold) to 135°C (2 min hold), at a rate of 15°C/min., then to 185°C (2 min hold), at a rate of 5°C/min, to a final temperature of 290°C at a rate of 5°C/min. The analogue signal was integrated with a Spectra Physics integrator. The identification of resolved aliphatic hydrocarbons was made by comparing retention times with corresponding standards (Chem Service). Resolved aliphatic hydrocarbons and unresolved complex mixtures (UCM) were calculated using the mean response factors of n-alkanes. Procedural blanks and standards were run in association with samples. Recovery assays were made by spiking a pristine sample. The results were 94.5 ± 11.6% (n=5) for C20–C28 n-alkanes. Results were not corrected for recoveries. The reproducibility of the method for the synthetic standard mixture at the spiked level of 1 μg/g of dry weight sediment varied from 9.3% to 16.5%.</segment><segment>For each station, the individual n-alkane concentrations from n-C11 to n-C30, the isoprenoid pristane and phytane concentrations, the total resolved n-alkanes, the UCMs, and the total aliphatic fractions were calculated. The UCM involves cycloalkanes, branched alkanes, and other compounds unresolved by the capillary column which show as a `hump&apos; below the resolved compounds. The total aliphatic fraction was defined as the sum of the identifiable alkane peaks and the unidentifiable complex mixture, if present.</segment><segment>Since natural samples are extremely complex, different parameters in addition to absolute concentration have to be analysed in order to evaluate the probable origin of hydrocarbons (anthropogenic or biogenic). In addition, the combination of different indices applied to the same sample, reinforces this understanding. The anthropogenic source may be petroleum, but it can also be recycled organic matter of different origin, such as sewage, soil organic matter washed by rains and effluents from treatment plants. Biogenic sources may be, for example, algae, plankton, marine animals, terrestrial vascular plants and bacteria. The evaluation indices selected in this study were</segment><segment>(a) Major hydrocarbon (MH): denotes the highest n-alkane concentration. This index is often around C18 for oily samples (Clark and Finley, 1973). C15, C17, C19 and C21 have been described as important components in different types of algae (both macro and micro-algae), and C23, C25, C27, C29 and C31 for vascular land plants Broman et al., 1987 and Colombo et al., 1989.</segment><segment>(b) The low/high molecular weight hydrocarbons (LMW/HMW): it is the ratio of the sum of n-alkanes ⩽C20 over the sum of n-alkanes ⩾21. Ratio values of 1.0 have been reported for algae, plankton and petroleum, while sedimentary bacteria, seawater, marine animals, higher plants and sediments show relatively lower values (Gearing et al., 1976).</segment><segment>(c) n-C16 ratio: it is the sum of all n-alkanes/n-C16. This ratio tends to be small (&lt;15) for petroleum-contaminated samples, while it is larger (&gt;50) for biological samples ( Clark and Finley, 1973).</segment></fulltext>

	<title>The Distribution of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Surficial Sediments of Sydney Harbour, Australia </title>
	<fulltext><segment>polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; PAH; Sydney Harbour; sediments; sediment quality guidelines; estuary</segment><segment>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment. This stems from the fact that they form during incomplete combustion of organic matter and consequently have numerous sources. Sources of anthropogenic combustion include combustion of fossil fuels, coal gasification and liquification processes, waste incineration and production of coke, carbon black, coal tar pitch, asphalt and petroleum cracking (Hallet and Brecher, 1984, and references therein). Apart from combustion processes, another common anthropogenic source of PAHs is spillage of fossil fuels including unrefined (crude oil) and refined products (e.g. petrol). PAHs also stem from natural combustion sources such as forest fires, and certain compounds (perylene and retene) are thought to be produced diagenetically (Wakeham et al., 1980b).</segment><segment>Much work has been conducted into identifying sources of PAHs in sediments (e.g. Youngblood and Blumer, 1975, Lake et al., 1979, Wakeham et al., 1980a, Sporstøl et al., 1983 and Canton and Grimalt, 1992). Pyrolytic and petrogenic sources are known to generate substantially different PAH assemblages. High temperature combustion processes generate PAH mixtures which are quantitatively similar, regardless of the fuel material burned (Laflamme and Hites, 1978 and Prahl and Carpenter, 1983; and references therein). Here, the predominant PAH compounds are the parent or non-alkylated compounds, and only relatively minor levels of alkylated homologues are present. In contrast, PAH mixtures in unburnt fossil fuels contain higher levels of alkylated PAH than corresponding non-alkylated PAH structures. The relative abundance of PAH compounds is dependent on the source temperature and low-to-moderate source temperatures may result in PAH assemblages with intermediate characteristics to those just described (Laflamme and Hites, 1978). In general, combustion PAH assemblages are dominated by relatively high molecular weight compounds with three condensed rings or more, whereas, mono-, bi- and tricyclic aromatic compounds are most abundant in fossil fuel PAH mixtures (Prahl and Carpenter, 1983).</segment><segment>Concern over PAHs results from their known carcinogenic behaviour (Arcos and Argus, 1975). Because of their hydrophobic nature, PAHs may accumulate to high concentrations in sediments. Recently, interim sediment quality guidelines have been published, as part of the draft Australian and New Zealand Guidelines for Fresh and Marine Water Quality (ANZECC and ARMCANZ, 1999, pp. 139–156). These guidelines serve to protect benthic biota from the adverse toxic effects of PAHs and other sedimentary contaminants. Due to a paucity of local toxicological data, the Australian and New Zealand sediment quality guidelines are based on those developed for North American sediments from a large database of matching chemical and biological effects data (Long et al., 1995). In this approach, Effects-Range Low (ERL) and Effects-Range Median (ERM) sediment quality guidelines were derived from the lowest 10 percentile and 50 percentile of biological effects data, separating concentrations of contaminants into ranges that were rarely (&lt;ERL), occasionally (⩾ERL,&lt;ERM) and frequently (⩾ERM) associated with acute toxicological effects (Long et al., 1995). These guidelines have been shown to successfully predict toxicity (Long et al., 1998) and therefore, are useful as screening guidelines (Long and MacDonald, 1998). In this study, the ERL and ERM guidelines were used to estimate the potential of adverse effects resulting from PAH contamination in Sydney Harbour sediments.</segment><segment>ERL and ERM guidelines were derived for 12 of the 16 PAH compounds listed as priority pollutants by the US EPA (Keith and Telliard, 1979). Effects-range guidelines do not exist for the high molecular weight compounds benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene and benzo(ghi)perylene, but were derived for 2-methylnaphthalene, which is not a priority pollutant. In this paper, PAH results are presented for all 16 US EPA priority pollutant PAH compounds and 2-methylnaphthalene.</segment><segment>Sydney Harbour is a highly urbanized estuary located in the geographic centre of Sydney, the largest city in Australia with a population of 4 million. The foreshores of the harbour have an extensive history of industrial use and the harbour was a convenient site for waste disposal for many decades. Today, however, very few factories remain on the foreshores and relatively rapid re-development to high-value medium density housing has occurred in recent years. Despite the visual improvement of the foreshores of Sydney Harbour, and the introduction of anti-pollution legislation in the early 1970s which prevents direct discharge of industrial effluent into the harbour, some areas of Sydney Harbour still contain high levels of heavy metals in surface sediments Irvine and Birch, 1998 and Birch and Taylor, 2000. Heavy metal and organochlorine pesticide concentrations in surficial sediment are generally highest in the upper reaches of embayments and tributaries and the abundance of these contaminants decreases rapidly towards the mouth of the estuary (Birch and Taylor, 2000). No studies of PAHs in surficial sediments in Sydney Harbour have been published.</segment><segment>The major objective of the current study was to determine the distribution of PAHs in surficial sediments in Sydney Harbour. The distribution and nature of PAHs were further investigated to identify possible sources of these contaminants, and the potential toxicological significance was evaluated by comparison with effects-based sediment quality guidelines.</segment><segment>Sediment samples were collected from 124 sites in Sydney Harbour between 23 November and 1 December 1998 (Fig. 1). The sites cover the entire extent of the estuary and represent the full range of sediment textures from fine-grained mud to coarse-grained sand.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Sediment sampling locations in Sydney Harbour (n=124).Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>The sediment samples were collected with a stainless steel boxcorer with a penetration of between 1cm and 20 cm, depending on the sediment texture. At each site, the top 1–2 cm of surface sediment was carefully removed with a stainless steel spoon and transferred to new 120 ml glass screw cap jars with aluminium foil lid liners. The sediment samples were transported back to the laboratory on ice and stored at 4°C before analysis.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Amphipods are Good Bioindicators of the Impact of Oil Spills on Soft-Bottom Macrobenthic Communities </title>
	<fulltext><segment>Amoco Cadiz; Aegean Sea; oil; bioindicators; amphipods; polychaetes</segment><segment>Since the end of the 1980s, the number of oil spills have dramatically decreased due to the reduction in the quantity of oil carried at sea, 431 million t less in 1986 than in 1977 (GESAMP, 1991), and high levels of security of navigation. So 1995 was the best year to date with only 9000 t spilled at sea (ITOPF, 1996). Nevertheless there has been a considerable annual variation although the majority of oil spills are small (less than 7 t). Some catastrophic releases have occurred in recent years, e.g. Aegean Sea 1992, Braer 1993, Sea Empress 1996 and Erika in 1999. By contrast, the preceding years 1960–1980 were characterized by numerous major oil spills (more than 700 t) with some of them being enormous judging by the volume of oil entering in the marine environment as well as the impact of the pollution on marine communities. Among the more important ones, there were the catastrophes of the Torrey Canyon in 1967 (Smith, 1968), Urquiola in 1976 (Gundlach and Hayes, 1977), the Amoco Cadiz in 1978 (Laubier, 1991), the Mexican Ixtoc I in 1979 (Lee et al., 1980), and the Exxon Valdez in 1989 Holloway &amp; Horgan, 1991, Feder &amp; Blanchard, 1998 and Jewett et al., 1999. The impact of some other smaller spills has been very well studied in terms of short-and long-term changes on marine communities, see Sanders et al. (1980) for the oil spill of the barge ‘Florida’ in 1977, and Elmgren et al. (1983), Lindén et al. (1979) for the ‘Tsesis’ oil spill also in 1977. The effects of very small accidents like the Antonio Gramsci in 1979 and Nella Dan in 1987 on the littoral benthic communities have also been studied Bonsdorff, 1981 and Smith and Simpson, 1998. Some general features on the impact of the spills on macrobenthic species and communities have resulted in a few key observations: (i) species sensitive to hydrocarbons, especially crustaceans, and especially amphipods, disappear rapidly and show very high initial mortalities, (ii) the initial impact is correlated with the importance of sensitive species in natural conditions, (iii) in some cases no sensitive species or opportunistic species, especially polychaetes which usually proliferate after an increase of organic matter, show important increases of abundance 1–3 years after the stress, and (iv) the duration of colonization of affected species after an oil spill generally surpasses 10 years Smith, 1968, Laubier, 1991, Holloway &amp; Horgan, 1991 and Dauvin, 1998.</segment><segment>At the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, many studies emerged on bioindicators of pollution or pollution indices to represent the structure and spatio-temporal changes of the marine benthic communities (e.g. Pearson and Rosenberg, 1978; Glémarec &amp; Hily, 1981, Bellan, 1980, Bellan, 1984 and Raffaelli &amp; Mason, 1981). These works underlined the potential to group macrobenthic species into categories according to sensitivity, resistance or proliferation along a pollution gradient.</segment><segment>The effects of the wreck on the infralittoral muddy-sand macrobenthic communities from the Ria de Ares and Betanzos of the Aegean Sea in Galicia (Spain) in 1992s were monitored for four years (1992–1996) to reveal the main features of this impact. This work showed a very high similarity with the impact of the Amoco Cadiz oil spill on the infralittoral communities from the Bay of Morlaix (western English Channel). The comparison of these two oil spills reveals general patterns of the effects of oil on soft-bottom macrobenthic species and populations. The objectives of this paper are: (i) to describe the effects of oil pollution over four years such a spill, (ii) to compare the impact of the Amoco Cadiz and the Aegean oil spill on two infralittoral bays, and (iii) to propose a selection of species suitable for use in monitoring the biological effects of oil pollution on macrobenthic communities.</segment><segment>Bay of Morlaix ( Fig. 1). The Pierre Noire (PN) site, in the Abra alba–Hyalinoecia bilineata fine sand macrobenthic community, is located in the eastern part of the Bay of Morlaix, France (48°42.50′N; 3°51.96′W). The sediment is fine sand and shows low temporal changes ( Table 1). Hydrological characteristics present few seasonal or multi-annual fluctuations; the bottom temperatures ranged from 8°C in March to 15°C in September, and the salinity varied between 34.5 P.S.U. in winter and 35.3 PSU at the beginning of October (Dauvin, 1984).</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Location of the PN and RM sites in the Bay of Morlaix.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Entanglement of Pinnipeds in Synthetic Materials at South-east Farallon Island, California, 1976–1998 </title>
	<fulltext><segment>entanglement; marine debris; pinnipeds; California</segment><segment>Entanglement in synthetic marine debris has been reported for many pinniped species (Bonner, 1982), and is thought to have contributed to population declines in the depleted Northern Fur Seal, Callorhinus ursinus (Fowler, 1987), as well as the endangered Hawaiian Monk Seal, Monachus shauinslandi (Henderson, 1990). In a survey for human-made debris at sea, Day et al. (1990) encountered thousands of items of debris, but few entangled marine mammals. Due to difficulties in monitoring marine mammal interactions with deployed fishing gear or entangled pinnipeds at sea, observational records of entangled marine mammals at haul out sites provides one of few insights into problems and threats to pinniped populations and sources of synthetic materials that entangle pinnipeds.</segment><segment>Stewart and Yochem, 1987 and Stewart and Yochem, 1990 documented entanglement for pinnipeds hauled out at San Miguel and San Nicolas Islands in Southern California, 1983–1988. They noted an increase in the proportion of entangled California Sea Lions (Zalophus californianus) and Pacific Harbor Seals (Phoca vitulina richardsi), and a decline in entangled Northern Elephant Seals (Mirounga angustirostris). Heneman (1985) reported on 13 California Sea Lions and three Northern Elephant Seals observed entangled in synthetic material at South-east Farallon Island (SEFI), 1979–1983. Otherwise, there are no published reports of entanglement of free-ranging pinnipeds in Northern California.</segment><segment>This report summarizes trends of pinnipeds entangled in synthetic material and types of entangling material for 914 pinnipeds hauled out at SEFI, 1976–1998. Findings are compared to those of earlier studies and the potential impact of synthetic materials on pinniped populations in Northern California is considered.</segment><segment>Biologists of the Point Reyes Bird Observatory have surveyed and studied flora and fauna at SEFI (37°42′N and 123°00′W) year-round since 1969. Pinnipeds which routinely haul out on the island include California Sea Lions, Northern Elephant Seals, Steller Sea Lions (Eumetopias jubatus), and Pacific Harbor Seals (Sydeman and Allen, 1999). Small numbers of Northern Fur Seals and Guadalupe fur seals (Arctocephalus townsendi) have been observed hauling out more frequently in recent years Hanni et al., 1996 and Pyle et al., in review. Data collection efforts were conducted in a standardized manner with generally consistent daily observation effort focusing on the vertebrate ecology (DeSante and Ainley, 1980). Efforts included weekly surveys of pinnipeds hauled out at SEFI, weather permitting. Species, age, and gender of animals surveyed were recorded when possible according to the criteria of Huber et al. (1985). Entanglement or evidence of entanglement based on typical open wounds or constrictions around an animal’s neck (Nakajima et al., 1990) were noted during surveys or daily routine biological work around the island. Information about each entangled animal was logged daily in the species journal by island biologists. When animals were accessible, and it would not disturb other hauled out animals, attempts were made to remove entangling material using a 3/4 in. thick 3 m long metal pole with a curved boat hook attached to the proximal end. One side of the hook was ground flat and two holes approximately 2 cm apart were drilled in the hook. A razor blade was affixed with small screws and bolts through the holes such that the blade spanned the inside curve of the hook. Species, date of observation, age, gender, entanglement type, and weekly census totals were collated from the SEFI species daily journal for analyses. Resighted animals were excluded from analyses.</segment><segment>Types of entanglement included: (i) monofilament – line, net, or unknown (type not specified or identified); (ii) trawl – a heavy, corded fishnet material; (iii) unknown fishnet material; (iv) salmon flasher (approximately 3 × 6 in. silver lure); (v) fish hook; (vi) packing strap; (vii) other – miscellaneous marine debris; and (viii) constriction (no material observed, but a circular indentation present around head, neck, or torso).</segment><segment>Entanglement type by year and total entangled by age-class were summarized for each species. Interannual trends in entangled pinnipeds at SEFI for the years 1981–1998 were analyzed using linear regression (Seber, 1977). To assess the trend of numbers of entangled animals in relation to the total number of pinnipeds hauled out at the island (as an index of population size), regression analyses for each species included annual means of the monthly counts for that species. Too few or no records of entanglement for Pacific Harbor Seals, Northern Fur Seals and Guadalupe fur seals existed for statistical analyses. Analyses were considered significant at p&lt;0.05. Results are interpreted cautiously due to potential confounding by numerous factors, including observer bias, variation in pinniped haulout patterns, the variety of ways in which pinnipeds may become entangled in synthetic materials, and the possibility that some records were actually resights of the same animal over time.</segment><segment>From 1 January 1976 to 31 December 1998, a total of 914 pinnipeds were observed with evidence of present and past entanglement in a variety of debris (Table 1). Of these, 296 (32%) were entangled in observed material, while 618 (68%) had constrictions.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Benthic Foraminiferal Tolerance to Tri-n-Butyltin (TBT) Pollution in an Experimental Mesocosm </title>
	<fulltext><segment>benthic foraminifera; mesocosm; antifouling; TBT; Gullmar Fjord; Skagerrak</segment><segment>Tri-n-butyltin (TBT) has been used in the marine environment as a toxic agent in antifouling paints during the last three decades (Hugget et al., 1992). Increased concentrations of TBT (0.05–5 nm) in contaminated areas have adverse effects on non-target organisms in the environment (Bryan and Gibbs, 1991). The environmental hazard of TBT led to legislation that restricted the use of TBT-containing antifouling paint on pleasure craft in many countries Ritsema and Laane, 1991 and Hugget et al., 1992. This paint is, however, still used for commercial vessels and organotin compounds are also used as wood preservatives and as disinfectants McDonald and Trevors, 1988 and Fent, 1989. A periphyton community exposed to TBT concentrations of 0.5 nm or more lost sensitive species, both in a microcosm experiment (Dahl and Blanck, 1996) and in the field (Blanck and Dahl, 1996) where a more tolerant periphyton community developed. Dahllöf et al. (1999) showed that minute additions of fresh TBT to an already contaminated sediment have effects on the microorganisms, at nominal concentrations of nmol of TBT added per square metre. The ecotoxicology of foraminifera is not well known though there are some studies of metal toxicity on foraminifera. Schafer et al. (1975) found that some foraminiferal species survived high heavy metal concentrations (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn). However, in these cases the foraminiferal fauna showed lower abundance and diversity. Ostracods and mollusks were shown to be even more sensitive. It is also known that some foraminiferal species are more tolerant to heavy metals than nematodes (Seiglie, 1975). The foraminiferal fauna decreased in both diversity and faunal abundance in Cu, Pb, Zn and Hg contaminated sediments from the Sørfjord, Norway (Alve, 1991). The same phenomenon was observed in the Mediterranean (Yanko et al., 1998). Both Alve, 1991 and Yanko et al., 1998 also observed a high degree of test (foraminiferal shell) deformations in contaminated areas. In a colonization experiment Alve and Olsgard (1999) found significantly decreased abundance of Stainforthia fusiformis and Bolivinellina pseudopunctata where very high concentrations of Cu (900–2000 ppm) were present.</segment><segment>In this study, surface sediment (0–1 cm) samples were collected at one station at 60 m depth in the Gullmar Fjord (N58°16,63′; E11°29,80′), on the Swedish west coast. The fjord has a maximum depth of 119 m and the sill depth is 42 m. A strong thermohaline stratification with a pycnocline between 15 and 20 m is imported from the Skagerrak (Svansson, 1984). Below the pycnocline the salinity is about 34‰ (Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institut). Sediment samples were collected in May 1995 using a Box corer (0.25 m2). Three groups with four replicate mesocosms in each were setup at Kristineberg Marine Research Station at the Gullmar Fjord. The mesocosms were provided with continuously running seawater from 35 m depth in the fjord. A detailed description of the mesocosm system is given in Molander et al. (2000). TBT was added at three different nominal concentrations of 0.00, 0.02 and 2.00 nmol of TBT/g dry sediment to a slurry of sieved (&lt;1 mm) sediment. The slurry was carefully spread in the overlying water-mass of the mesocosms and allowed to settle during 48 h, before the water circulation was put back on. Two days before sampling one of the 0.02 nmol mesocosms broke, therefore only three samples are used in this group.</segment><segment>The background concentration of TBT on the Swedish west coast is between 0.01 and 38 nmol/g dry sediment (Cruz and Molander, 1998), and in the Gullmar Fjord 0.08 nmol/g dry sediment (Dahllöf et al., 1999). This means that the highest addition is well within the range on contamination and the lowest addition represents a mere doubling of the lowest background concentration.</segment><segment>After seven months in December 1995 the surface sediment from each mesocosm (0.25 m2) was scraped off to 1 cm depth, homogenized and a 50 ml sub-sample was preserved in an equal amount of 95% ethanol. To the sediment and ethanol mixture, 1 g/l of Rose Bengal was added overnight and the samples were then sieved through 1000 and 63 μm sieves. Rose Bengal staining of foraminifera is considered a reliable method of distinguishing dead (unstained) from living (stained) foraminifera (Alve and Bernhard, 1995), although under certain circumstances preserved, post mortem, protoplasm can remain stainable some time after death Bernhard, 1988 and Bernhard, 1989. About 300 stained foraminifera in the 63 μm fraction were counted and picked with a Pasteur pipette in each sample and dried at 20°C on a filter paper (Table 1).</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Copper Effects on Potential Sediment Test Organisms: the Importance of Appropriate Sensitivity </title>
	<fulltext><segment>copper; sediment; toxicity; toxicant sensitivity</segment><segment>Recently, the authors were involved in sediment toxicity testing in tropical estuarine waters. The test site was located in south-east Asia in an area where there were no appropriate resident species for testing. In other words, resident species had not previously been used or validated for use in sediment toxicity testing. The primary toxicant of concern was copper in the sediments. The decision was made to conduct initial sediment toxicity testing using a validated North American test species, specifically the amphipod Eohaustorius estuarius. This amphipod was chosen because it is considered sensitive, has been shown to tolerate estuarine conditions and a wide range of sediment grain size types (i.e., grain size is not a potentially confounding factor as it is in some other tests), and because test procedures are well established Environment Canada, 1992, Environment Canada, 1998, US EPA, 1994 and PSEP, 1995.</segment><segment>However, before sediment testing was initiated, and as a precaution, a water-only toxicity test was conducted to determine the sensitivity of E. estuarius to copper. This test showed that this amphipod was relatively insensitive to copper and not suitable for testing copper-contaminated sediments (cf. Amphipod Testing). A literature review was then conducted to determine the relative sensitivities of different marine and estuarine organisms to copper (cf. Relative Sensitivities to Copper). Based on this literature review, a different amphipod, Ampelisca abdita, was chosen for testing. This North American amphipod also tolerates estuarine conditions, but is associated with fine-grained sediments, and has standardized test procedures US EPA, 1994 and PSEP, 1995. Water-only testing (cf. Amphipod Testing) indicated that this amphipod was appropriately sensitive to copper and it was subsequently used for the aforementioned sediment toxicity tests.</segment><segment>The purpose of this viewpoint is 2-fold: to provide information on relative sensitivities to copper; and to use this example to emphasize the importance of ensuring that test organisms are appropriately sensitive to contaminants in environmental samples.</segment><segment>Two benthic amphipod species, E. estuarius and A. abdita, were tested for sensitivity to copper in static, 96-h water-only tests. Both species of amphipods were field collected and acclimated in the laboratory prior to testing.</segment><segment>Test solutions were prepared from 10 mg/l or 1000 mg/l Cu stock solutions. The range-finder test was done using copper sulphate; definitive tests were conducted using copper chloride. Two different copper salts were used to see if this would reduce precipitation in the higher test concentrations, but all concentrations are reported in terms of the amount of copper ion (i.e., mg/l or μg/l Cu). Chemical analyses confirmed actual concentrations of these stock solutions were within 10% of their nominal concentration.</segment><segment>Since no data on copper toxicity were available for E. estuarius, an initial range-finder test was run spanning the range of 0.01–100 mg/l Cu; the subsequent definitive test spanned the range from 3 to 100 mg/l Cu (3000–100 000 μg/l Cu). In both these tests, a copper precipitate was noted at concentrations ⩾3 mg/l Cu. Limited data on copper toxicity were available for A. abdita so no range-finder test was run; the definitive test concentrations ranged from 0.012 to 0.4 mg/l Cu (12.5–400 μg/l Cu). No copper precipitate was observed in the A. abdita test. Copper concentrations were verified by chemical analyses with appropriate quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) during testing.</segment><segment>Testing was conducted in 1-litre glass jars containing 900 ml of test solutions at 15±1°C under continuous light. Clean seawater was used as the negative (clean) control, and reference toxicant tests were conducted using cadmium (routinely used for this purpose in this laboratory). One replicate was prepared for each treatment, and was seeded with 10 amphipods. Gentle aeration was provided but amphipods were not fed. Water quality (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity) was checked daily and was within acceptable limits. Containers were checked daily for mortalities during the 96-h exposure.</segment><segment>Survival in the negative controls was consistently &gt;90%, and reference toxicant tests were within the range of acceptable values obtained by the laboratory during previous testing. For E. estuarius the 96-h LC50 values based on nominal and measured copper were 12.5–25 and 3.7 mg/l Cu, respectively, indicating very low sensitivity to copper. In contrast, for A. abdita the 96-h LC50 values based on nominal and measured copper were 42.4 and 33.5 μg/l Cu, respectively, indicating a much higher sensitivity to copper.</segment><segment>Few studies have been conducted to specifically investigate the toxicity of copper in spiked-sediment studies. Available data on the toxicity of copper to marine and estuarine invertebrates in experiments performed with spiked sediments are provided in Table 1.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Effects of Residual Exxon Valdez Oil on Intertidal Protothaca staminea: Mortality, Growth, and Bioaccumulation of Hydrocarbons in Transplanted Clams </title>
	<fulltext><segment>Exxon Valdez; Alaska; oil spill; Protothaca staminea; growth; bioaccumulation</segment><segment>Damage to intertidal biota following an oil spill is often attributed to acute toxicity and smothering, but chronic effects of oil may have the greatest long-term impact on the community. In a disturbance such as an oil spill, organisms sensitive to residual oil may either be reduced in numbers or eliminated from the community. Recolonization of oiled areas may be impeded. Although physiological stress of accommodating weathered oil may not be immediately fatal to some organisms, it may impede growth and reproduction. Biota within soft-sediment substrata can be especially susceptible to long-term effects of oil Mann and Clark, 1978, Cairns and Buikema, 1984 and Teal and Howarth, 1984. Sheltered mudflats and coarse gravel-pebble substrata are areas where chronic effects of oil on biota may persist since oil tends to seep into and mix with sediments. Weathering of oil occurs slowly due to reduced oxygen conditions and infauna may be adversely affected for many years. Chronic effects of oil on intertidal organisms may also affect community structure by altering survival, growth, reproduction, and recruitment of future generations.</segment><segment>Previous studies have examined recovery patterns of infaunal communities following oil spills (e.g., Elmgren et al., 1983 and Driskell et al., 1996). Generally, meiofauna recover within a short time Wormald, 1976 and Alongi et al., 1983 whereas macroinfaunal populations take longer (e.g., Linden et al., 1979 and Conan, 1982). Estimates of recovery times for infaunal communities in soft sediment habitats range from 4 to 5 years Michael et al., 1975, Elmgren et al., 1981 and Elmgren et al., 1983.</segment><segment>The littleneck clam, Protothaca staminea (Conrad, 1837) (hereafter Protothaca), is an important component of infaunal communities in the northeast Pacific. It is used for human subsistence and is an important food for sea otters, diving ducks, and some terrestrial animals. Biology of this species in Prince William Sound (PWS) is known from several other areas. Growth rates Paul and Feder, 1973, Paul et al., 1976a and Paul et al., 1976b, weight to length ratios (Feder and Paul, 1973), reproduction (Feder et al., 1979), and recruitment (Paul and Feder, 1973) are well documented. Since these clam live at shallow sediment depths, they are susceptible to acute impacts from oil spills as well as chronic effects from oil remaining in the sediment.</segment><segment>Several studies have examined oil impacts on survival, growth, and body burdens for Protothaca. Clams exposed to Prudhoe Bay crude oil for two months had good survival though overall condition was reduced (Augenfeld et al., 1980). Protothaca was not affected by oil exposure as much as another clam, Macoma balthica, due to different routes of exposure from feeding activities. Results of a study examining effects of (1) crude oil and (2) oil dispersants on Protothaca showed that the dispersant was much more toxic to clams (Hartwick et al., 1982). Growth of Protothaca exposed to weathered oil in sediments was significantly impaired (Anderson et al., 1983).</segment><segment>We evaluated residual effects of Exxon Valdez (EV) crude oil on Protothaca using experimental reciprocal clam transplants. Effects of oil on clams have human health and ecological implications. Additionally, since restoration techniques, following a large scale disturbance such as an oil spill, can include replanting or reseeding, it is desirable to understand effectiveness of clam transplants to oiled areas. The following questions were evaluated:</segment><segment>•Did chronic exposure of Protothaca to EV oil affect survival of clams in oiled and unoiled areas?•Did long-term exposure of Protothaca to EV oil following the spill affect growth of clams in oiled and unoiled areas?•To what extent did transplanted clams in PWS accumulate or depurate hydrocarbons?</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Locations of the two study sites in Prince William Sound, Alaska.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>In June 1994, 250 clams were collected from an oiled site at Block Island and an unoiled site at Outside Bay; total length was measured (clams 15–40 mm long were selected for transplant); and each clam tagged with coloured, uniquely numbered plastic tags. Tags colour-coded by site (yellow=Block Island, orange=Outside Bay) were attached with marine epoxy to individual clams. Clams were held in clean seawater for at least 24 h prior to transplant to insure that tags were solidly affixed to the shell and to check for initial handling mortality. Ten quadrats measuring 0.5 × 0.5 m2 (0.25 m2) were used at each site. Twenty-five tagged clams were planted in each quadrat (approximating natural densities) after removal of all native clams. In each quadrat, half the tagged clams (12 or 13) were control clams that were removed from the site of origin and replaced, and half originated from the other site. Each quadrat was marked with a steel spike and flagging to insure that quadrats were resampled in the same orientation. An additional 40–50 clams, and sediments from each site, were collected during the course of regular monitoring for hydrocarbon analyses.</segment><segment>Remnant oiling at Block Island was concentrated at the base of a tombolo (a gravel bar connecting a small island to the mainland) so quadrats were arranged in a circular pattern around the area of heaviest residual oil at a tidal elevation of +1 to +1.5 m MLLW. Ten quadrats were excavated at a random distance of 1–5 m from the central point at compass directions of every 36°. Half the quadrats were sampled in June 1995, the other half in July 1996. The Outside Bay unoiled plots were arranged parallel to the shore along a tidal gradient of 0 to +0.5 m MLLW. Half of the quadrats were recovered in 1995. In 1996, clams in only three of the five remaining quadrats were recovered.</segment><segment>All clams collected were measured in the field with Vernier calipers and immediately frozen for chemical tissue analyses at Louisiana State University (LSU) laboratories. Clams from the 1995 collection were analysed for total target aromatic hydrocarbons (TTAH), but clams collected in 1996 collections were archived and not analysed. Dead tagged clams were collected from within quadrats and areas adjacent to each quadrat. Missing tagged clams were assumed dead for mortality analyses.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>The Role of Burrows of the SW Atlantic Intertidal Crab Chasmagnathus granulata in Trapping Debris </title>
	<fulltext><segment>Benthos; bioturbation; intertidal crabs; entrainment; estuaries; plastics</segment><segment>The nature and extent of marine debris have been described for several places (e.g., Vauk and Schrey, 1987, Corbin and Singh, 1993 and Haynes, 1997) showing their environmental importance. They are important pollutants (Ross et al., 1991) affecting wildlife (e.g., Laist, 1987, Beck and Barros, 1991, Slip and Burton, 1991, Lucas, 1992 and Dixon and Dixon, 1981) often producing economic impacts due to loss of the aesthetic value of recreational areas Corbin and Singh, 1993, Garrity and Levings, 1993 and Faris and Hart, 1995. In most cases that we are aware of, the evaluation of debris is only based on superficial samples and does not include debris buried in the sediment. However, several burrowing species may directly or indirectly bury debris at such a rate that it deserves attention. Although buried debris may not directly affect aesthetic values; they may still have an effect on wildlife.</segment><segment>Benthic fauna plays an important role in the sedimentary processes leading to important changes in marsh characteristics (Bertness and Miller, 1984). The fauna of mudflats and creeks includes many deposit and filter feeders that modify sediment particle size and its chemistry (Raffaelli and Hawkins, 1996). Their burrowing activities may have considerable effects on soil aeration, growth and distribution of the flora (Bertness, 1985). Crabs are important habitat modifiers, both in salt marshes (e.g., Montague, 1980, Bertness, 1985 and Botto and Iribarne, 1999) and mangroves (e.g., Warren and Underwood, 1986). They are usually present in large numbers (e.g., Bertness and Miller, 1984 and Iribarne et al., 1997), significantly influencing microtopography, sediment chemistry and drainage Bertness, 1985, Iribarne et al., 1997, Bortolus and Iribarne, 1999 and Botto and Iribarne, in press.</segment><segment>The burrowing crab Chasmagnathusgranulata is one of the most abundant macroinvertebrates in the salt marshes of the South Western Atlantic (e.g., Boschi, 1964, Spivak et al., 1994, Iribarne et al., 1997 and Bortolus and Iribarne, 1999). This species inhabits the intertidal, from the soft bare sediment flats to areas vegetated by the cordgrass Spartina densiflora Boschi, 1964 and Spivak et al., 1994. They excavate and maintain semipermanent open burrows Boschi, 1964 and Spivak et al., 1994 that can extend up to 1 m into the marsh sediment and with an average density of 20 crab m−2, but this can be as high as 60 crab m−2(Iribarne et al., 1997). Sediment removed totals up to 5 kg m−2 day−1 in open mudflats (Iribarne et al., 1997), and all evidence suggests that this species plays a key role in marsh production and integrity Iribarne et al., 1997, Bortolus and Iribarne, 1999, Botto and Iribarne, 1999 and Botto and Iribarne, in press.</segment><segment>Several pieces of evidence suggests that crab burrows in intertidal mudflats increase the trapping of bedload-transported materials (Iribarne et al., 1997). The burrow entrances differ between sites, being funnel-shaped in the mudflat (up to 20 cm in diameter) area and straight tunnels (up to 10-cm in diameter) in Spartina marshes. The funnel-shaped entrance works as a sediment trap for the thalassinean shrimp Callianassa spp. (e.g. Suchanek, 1983, Poore and Suchanek, 1988, Witbaard and Duineveld, 1989, Vaugelas, 1990 and Nickell and Atkinson, 1995) and in this species (Botto and Iribarne, in press) by enhancing capture of bedload particles that slip down the sides of the funnel. This increase in size of the surface openings may also be related to opportunistic trapping of surface-deposited detritus, which increases the food content of the sediment. Measurements of particle fluxes through turbulent systems have shown that the collection efficiency of cylindrical traps increases with increasing height-width ratios Butman, 1986 and Butman et al., 1986. Furthermore, a flume study suggested that large Uca-mimic burrows in the field should contain a higher abundance of passively transported meiofauna than small or upright burrows (DePatra and Levin, 1989). The angle of the tunnel at the entrance also varies between sites, being mainly vertical in the marsh area but oblique in the mudflats (Iribarne et al., 1997). Oblique tunnels allow access to the sediment surface for the movement of sediment or macroorganic materials in or out of the burrow and would thus also suggest a deposit feeding or omnivorous scavenging trophic mode (Nickell and Atkinson, 1995). The flume study performed by DePatra and Levin (1989) also suggested that angled burrows should capture a higher abundance of passively transported meiofauna than upright burrows. Thus, all evidence strongly suggests that funnel-shaped and inclined burrows found in mudflats increases trapping of organic matter and are adaptive to deposit feeding Iribarne et al., 1997 and Botto and Iribarne, in press.</segment><segment>However, crab burrow architecture may also enhance the trapping of small and medium size debris. Given the extensive intertidal areas inhabited by this species in SW Atlantic estuaries, the effect of their burrows as modifiers of debris dynamics should not be underestimated. In this work, we evaluate under field conditions the effect of their burrows on the trapping of debris (mainly plastic), and the amount of debris buried in the sediment in areas with different crab densities.</segment><segment>The field study was performed at the Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon (Argentina, 37°32′ to 37°45′ S, and 57°19′ to 57°26′ W; Fig. 1) from spring 1997 to autumn 1999. The site is a body of brackishwater (approximately 46 km2) affected by low amplitude (⩽1 m) tides (i.e., Spivak et al., 1994) and characterized by mudflats and a large surrounding cordgrass (Spartina densiflora) area Fasano et al., 1982 and Bortolus and Iribarne, 1999. This lagoon is located 26 km north of the largest coastal tourist resort of Argentina, the city of Mar del Plata. Population in this city reaches up to half a million people during mid summer (mainly January and February) (Anonymous, 1998) and production of debris is very important.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Location of the Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon (MCCL) in Argentina (A) and location of the study sites (indicated by letters) at the entrance of the coastal lagoon (B).Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Aerial Surveillance of Operational Oil Pollution in Belgium’s Maritime Zone of Interest </title>
	<fulltext><segment>aerial surveillance; Bonn agreement; North Sea; oil pollution; statistics; Traffic Separation Scheme</segment><segment>The North Sea has some of the busiest shipping routes in the world, with about 420,000 shipping movements per year within its limits. Traffic is particularly heavy through the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) in the Strait of Dover, with at times 150 ships per day sailing along the axis to and from the North Sea, in addition to numerous ferry crossings and fishing trips (North Sea Task Force, 1993). Two major shipping lanes, the Noordhinder and Westhinder TSS, cross the Belgian maritime area, which is adjacent to the Dover Strait. A pernicious consequence of this dense shipping traffic is chronic oil pollution. Oil is known to have a significant impact on the marine environment O’Sullivan and Jacques, 1991, Clark, 1992 and North Sea Task Force, 1993.</segment><segment>Spilled oil is subjected to various weathering processes such as advection, spreading, evaporation, dispersion, emulsification, photo-oxidation, biodegradation and sedimentation/sinking (Reed et al., 1999). Initially, advection and spreading dominate the dynamics of a fresh spill under the influence of tidal and wind forcing, wave action, diffusion and buoyancy, which induce shear diffusion (Elliott et al., 1986). Empirically, weather conditions at sea are known to influence the lifetime of an oil spill, i.e. the period it remains visible on the sea surface National Research Council, 1985 and Kolluru et al., 1994.</segment><segment>The Southern Bight of the North Sea is highly productive (Longhurst, 1998). As a consequence, it is an important wintering ground for pelagic and coastal birds and an important passage zone for pelagic birds (Offringa et al., 1996). Unfortunately, the local mortality of many wintering or migrating birds, whose distribution spatially overlaps with the TSS, is related to oil pollution Debacker et al., 1997, Offringa and Meire, 1997 and Camphuysen, 1998. It would be a mistake however to assume that the oil threat originates only from within the TSS. Moreover, a mass mortality of seabirds is not necessarily caused by large accidental oil pollutions: the daily phenomenon of minor, recurrent oil pollutions from ships also takes its toll. Camphuysen (1989) recorded mass mortality of Common Scoters and Common Eiders in coastal waters caused by a minor oil pollution incident at a short distance from the shoreline. There is also a growing concern for the impact of very low concentrations of organic chemicals, including persistent oil fractions on the functioning of marine organisms (Hester and Harrison, 1999). Despite important international legal efforts to protect the marine environment and to prevent and repress oil pollution from ships United Nations, 1982 and IMO, 1997, the number of accidental and illegal operational oil spills from ships remains unacceptably high.</segment><segment>Within the framework of the Bonn Agreement (Le Moniteur Belge, 28.12.1989) and the Belgian law on the prevention of pollution of the sea by ships (Le Moniteur Belge, 27.06.1995), the Belgian federal government conducts an aerial surveillance program initiated in 1991, aiming inter alia at deterring illegal operational discharges and evaluating marine pollution in BMZI. BMZI includes the Belgian Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf and extends to the adjacent areas of the Bonn Agreement Zone of Joint Responsibility (Le Moniteur Belge, 28.12.1989). It covers two important shipping routes, the TSS connecting the Dover Strait with Rotterdam and Hamburg, and the TSS branching to the Scheldt estuary and Antwerp, including the Westhinder anchorage area ( Fig. 1). A detailed inventory of all observed accidental and operational oil spills at sea has been compiled by Schallier et al. (1996) and briefly discussed by Schallier (1998). This paper statistically analyses and discusses 228 observations of illegal operational oil spills made during the period between 1991 and 1995.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Locations of the oil spills (n=228) in the Belgian Zone of Interest observed between 1991 and 1995. The dark full line represents the border of the Belgian Continental Shelf; the light full line the border of the 12 nm Belgian Territorial Sea; the horizontal lines delimit the Bonn Agreement Joint Responsibility Zone and the dotted line the border of the Traffic Separation Schemes. The spill volumes are as indicated in the legend.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>The federal Management Unit of the North Sea and Scheldt Estuary Mathematical Models (MUMM) schedules regular surveillance flights in BMZI. Except in 1991, 140 to 170 flight hours were organised for pollution control annually. Each flight, lasting from 30 to 120 min, followed a predetermined route to ensure that the entire target area was surveyed on a regular basis. The remote-sensing aircraft is specially equipped with navigation instruments, camera and video camera, UV and IR sensors, and a Side Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR), allowing it to detect and document oil spills at the sea surface. Using SLAR, operators can detect oil spills on both sides of the aircraft at a distance of up to 20 km. Oil spill thickness was estimated from the colour pattern of the hydrocarbons on the sea surface according to internationally agreed procedures (Bonn Agreement, 1993). For each of the observed illegal operational oil spills, the following spill characteristics were noted during the flight: length, width, coverage percentage (oil to sea surface ratio) and colour. Surface area and volume of the oil spills were then calculated (Table 1). Wind speed and wind direction were obtained from the air traffic tower in Ostend (B). Significant wave height (Hs) averaged over 10 min and calculated from the mean of the 1/3 highest values was obtained from the monthly bulletin of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (Rijkswaterstaat, 1994).</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Variability of Trace-Metal Concentrations Within and Between Colonies of Pocillopora damicornis </title>
	<fulltext><segment>coelenterate; Pocillopora damicornis; environmental monitoring; bio-assay; heavy metals</segment><segment>Scleractinian corals meet several of the prerequisites for biological monitors suggested by Phillips (1990). They are long-lived, sessile organisms that are common in many tropical and sub-tropical marine ecosystems, compared with other potential indicator species, and they yield adequate tissue and skeleton material for analyses of trace-metals. Pocillopora damicornis is an easily recognized coral from which branches can be sampled with little effort without destroying entire colonies, and this species is widespread throughout the Indo-Pacific region. These features make P. damicornis attractive as a potential indicator species; it is a test species suggested by APHA, AWWA, WEF (1995), and has been used in several bio-assay studies investigating trace-metals in marine environments Howard and Brown, 1987, McConchie and Harriott, 1992 and Esslemont, in press.</segment><segment>Exploratory works conducted on corals from the Caribbean, Indo-Pacific, and South Pacific regions indicate that coral skeletons record ambient trace-metal concentrations that reflect environmental factors, such as El Niño events (Shen et al., 1987), anthropogenic inputs Dodge and Gilbert, 1984 and Shen et al, 1987, and river discharges (Shen and Sanford, 1990). Corals regulate the concentrations of some trace-metals in tissues Harland and Brown, 1989 and Esslemont, in press, which limits the usefulness of coral tissues for bio-assay purposes to a few metals and may modify how trace-metals are transferred to skeletons. However, overall indications are that coral skeletons show promise as long-term proxy monitors of the indicated environmental factors.</segment><segment>Natural variations of trace-metal concentrations in biological material need to be considered when designing bio-assays; for corals this variation needs to be considered at colony and population levels. Heterogeneous distributions of trace-metals in coral material have been reported at microscopic, colony and population scales Sinclair et al., 1998 and Esslemont, in press, which means that the systematics of representing trace-metals assimilated by coral populations and individual colonies require development. In this study, trace-metal concentrations (cadmium, lead, copper, nickel and chromium) are measured in tissues and skeletons of P. damicornis coral for three purposes:</segment><segment>1.To measure partitioning of cadmium, lead, copper, nickel and chromium, in coral tissue and skeleton phases.2.To evaluate how concentrations of these trace-metals accumulated by coral tissues and skeletons vary within and between colonies.3.To ascertain sample numbers needed to represent biological accumulation of trace-metals by corals at a sampling site, and minimum sample sizes needed to represent metals in coral tissues by flame atomic adsorption spectrophotometry (AAS).</segment><segment>Corals were sampled by SCUBA divers from an area of about 200×100 m2, and a depth of 15 m, in the Solitary Islands Marine Reserve, NSW, Australia (30°13′S, 153°16′E). This inner neritic site is largely free from siltation or significant river runout, and there are no known sources of trace-metals nearby. Trace-metals taken up by corals therefore represent accumulation by a healthy population under normal marine conditions. A single branch weighing 75–100 g was sampled from each of 19 replicate colonies to represent metal variation in the population, and three whole colonies were collected to provide sub-samples for measuring variation within colonies. The corals were transported live from the field in two 45 l, insulated plastic containers filled with seawater.</segment><segment>In the laboratory, whole colonies were carefully broken into 4–6 sub-samples weighing 75–100 g. All samples were rinsed with Milli-Q water, oven dried on plastic trays (60±10∘C for 48 h), and weighed. Tissues were prepared for metal analyses by the following procedure (Esslemont, 2000), which included mucus that spilled onto the trays during drying, and excluded visible endoliths. Samples were placed into 500 ml polycarbonate sample jars, oven dried (60°C for 48±1 h), then weighed. Fifty milliliter of hydrogen peroxide (9.7 M, pH adjusted to 8.2 with sodium hydroxide) was added to each sample, a perforated lid was screwed onto each jar, and samples were reacted at room temperature (20°C) for 1 h. Jars were heated in a water bath (70°C) for 3.5 h to complete tissue removal, and then digests were sieved through the perforated lids into 500 ml beakers, using a Milli-Q rinse for quantitative transfer (100 ml). Bleached skeleton surfaces were immersed in 50 ml of reducing chelate (117 mM sodium diethyl-dithiocarbamate; pH=5; 0.4 M L-ascorbic acid; 11.7 mM calcium chloride) for 20 min at room temperature (20°C). After reaction, chelates were quantitatively added to the peroxide digests (50 ml Milli-Q rinse). Lids were removed from the jars, and oven drying of the bleached skeletons for postdigestion weighing was as specified. Tissue biomasses were calculated by subtracting predigestion dry weights from postdigestion dry weights.</segment><segment>Tissue digests were acidified (1 ml of 12 M hydro chloric acid), and evaporated on a hotplate to about 20 ml. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide/nitric acid (70 ml of 9.7/16 M) was added to complete digestion, and samples evaporated to near dryness. Digests did not need filtration and were made to a final volume of 10 ml with dilute hydrochloric acid (12 mM), to which 2 ml of lanthanum chloride was added (0.18 M). Metals were analysed by AAS (GBC 903), with deuterium lamp background correction and calibration against matrix-matched external standards (BDH, Spectrosol). Procedural blanks had been inserted at regular intervals of ten samples in the processing and analytical sequence to quantify background (average of the blanks) and detection limits (95% confidence interval of the blanks).</segment><segment>After tissue digestion, remaining skeletons were prepared for trace metal analyses by the procedure detailed in Esslemont (1999). Portions ≤3 cm from branch-tips &lt;1 K)&quot; title=&quot;Full-size image (&lt;1 K)&quot; src=&quot;/sd/grey_pxl.gif&quot; data-inlimgeid=&quot;1-s2.0-S0025326X00000680-si2.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;1 K)&quot; title=&quot;Full-size image (&lt;1 K)&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0025326X00000680-si2.gif&quot;&gt; were sampled to represent recent skeleton growth, and placed in 50 ml test tubes. A modified version of the tissue-extraction sequence described above was used to ensure that skeleton surfaces were free of adsorbed metal phases and surface coatings (Esslemont, 1999). After skeletons had been cleaned and digested, concentrations of cadmium, lead and copper were measured by anodic stripping voltammetry, as follows. Aliquots of digests (0.3 ml) and blanks (0.2 ml) were each analysed in 10 ml of supporting electrolyte buffer (4 M sodium chloride, 0.4 M L-ascorbic acid, 0.39 M sodium hydroxide). Instrument parameters (Chemtronics PDV 2000) were: plating potential (−1000 mV), plating time (300 s), hold potential (−900 mV), hold time (15 s), sweep rate (999), Cd limit (−550 mV), Pb limit (−375 mV), Cu limit (−50 mV), final potential (0 mV), strip time (2 s), rest potential (−100 mV). A thick mercury plate was precipitated using 0.3 ml (rather than the usual 0.15 ml), of 3.68 mM mercury chloride solution in 5 ml Milli-Q water to counteract wear induced by the long plating time. Zinc, nickel and chromium were analysed by flame AAS (GBC 903) as indicated above.</segment><segment>Trace-metals in coral tissues represent those attached by organometallic complexes in flesh, mucus and zooxanthellae, and particles adhering to the mucus that could not be removed. Trace-metals in coral skeletons had been metabolized, and biogenically precipitated in substitutional solid solution with calcium. Some metal concentrations in coral tissues and skeleton were below analytical detection limits, and these values were rounded to half the detection limit to minimize errors. Because cadmium concentrations in skeletons were generally below the limit of quantification, the calculated partitioning of cadmium between the tissue and skeleton is an approximation only.</segment><segment>The strength of partitioning of the five metals in tissues and skeletons was analysed statistically by comparing tissue/skeleton ratios for individual metal concentrations in these phases using a Friedman test (Sheskin, 1977). This tests the null hypothesis that k-related variables (i.e., tissue/skeleton ratios of each metal) come from the same population (i.e., have the same distribution in the P. damicornis population). For each case, the k variables are ranked from 1 to k, and the test statistic is based on these ranks. Box-whisker plots were used to indicate intra-colony variation of trace-metal distributions in the three individual colonies, and were also used to indicate inter-colony variation in the 19 different coral colonies representing the whole population.</segment><segment>Direct proportion was used to assess the minimum sample weights required to provide sufficient tissue material for analysis by AAS, which has detection limits of 0.1 mg/l for cadmium, 0.2 mg/l for copper and chromium, and 0.5 mg/l for lead and nickel. Conservative assessments were made using the lower 95% confidence limits for dry-weight tissue biomass of P. damicornis (preliminary work showed the 95% confidence interval of tissue biomass is 1.3±0.6% of total dry sample weight), and also using metal concentrations in tissues measured in the following study. Calculation is demonstrated by the following worked example.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Early Contamination by Heavy Metals of the Guadalquivir Estuary After the Aznalcóllar Mining Spill (SW Spain) </title>
	<fulltext><segment>National Park of Doñana; Guadalquivir estuary; heavy metals; Aznalcóllar acid mine waste; sediments; pollution</segment><segment>On 25 April 1998, part of the tailings pond dike of the `Los Frailes&apos; zinc mine, situated in Aznalcóllar (Andalucı́a, Spain), collapsed, releasing an estimated 5 million cubic meters of acid wastewater rich in toxic metals over the next 5 days, killing most of the wildlife in its path and posing a long-term threat to the Guadalquivir ecosystem which encompasses the World Heritage site of the Doñana National Park and other protected areas. Following the accident, the acid water moved into the Guadiamar river (across much of the floodplain, covering agricultural land) and through it to the Guadalquivir river reaching the edges of the Doñana Parks (Fig. 1).</segment><segment>Fig. 1. General areas sampled and locations of sampling stations. GR indicates stations located in the `Brazo de la Torre&apos; of the Guadiamar river and GL indicates the Guadalquivir river and estuary.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>Trace metal concentrations in riverine, estuarine and coastal environments are subject to large temporal and spatial variations as a result of variability in the extent of run-off, erosion and pollution. Transient variations, point sources and trends in biogeochemical cycles of trace metals can only be detected by frequent and detailed measurements, including: water, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediments. In order to obtain such information, we have combined the initial results of four different studies: trace metal concentrations in both dissolved and particulate forms in the water column, including suspended solids and their form and distribution in sediments.</segment><segment>This paper presents the early results of the monitoring of contamination originated by the mining spill, in the Guadalquivir estuary and at the borders of the National Park of Doñana. It shows the distribution and metal concentration of Fe, Mn, Zn, Cd, Pb and Cu in the mentioned areas for water, SPM and sediments, evaluating their geochemical behaviour and their potential adverse effect in the area.</segment><segment>At Aznalcóllar, Zn, Pb, Cu and Mn-rich pyrite deposits are mined and the Agrio river receives the drainage water from open-cast-worked polymetal sulphide deposits and old mine spoil heaps (Cabrera et al., 1984). The Agrio then joins the Guadiamar, which is a major tributary of the southern Guadalquivir river. The threat posed to the Doñana Park through inputs of metals by mining activities from the Guadiamar and Guadalquivir rivers has been previously studied Cabrera et al., 1984, Albaiges et al., 1987, Arambarri et al., 1996 and DelValls et al., 1999.</segment><segment>To assess the influence of early contamination from the Aznalcóllar incident, in the Guadalquivir estuary and the surrounding areas, as well as to evaluate the efficiency of the emergency treatment pond in cleaning-up the acid water from the spill, 14 sampling stations were sited: eight in the Guadalquivir river and six through the Guadiamar artificial channel (Brazo de la Torre). The location of sampling sites and stations selected are showed in Fig. 1. Stations were sited following the gradient of contamination in the Guadiamar river (GR6 to GR1) and in the estuary (GL8 to GL1).</segment><segment>Sampling schedule, collection and treatments</segment><segment>Sampling for water and SPM was conducted during May, July, August and September 1998. During May and July, three different depths were selected in the Guadalquivir estuary (surface, medium and deep samples) for water and SPM analyses, during both high-tide and low-tide, otherwise only surface water was sampled. In May and September, sediments were also sampled.</segment><segment>Water samples were collected in acid-washed ruttner bottles made of polycarbonate, and rapidly transfered to 5 l polyethylene vessels and transported to the laboratory to be stored in the dark at 4°C until analyses. Due to this transportation conditions the metal measured in this aqueous phase could incorporate amounts of labile heavy metals from the particulate matter.</segment><segment>The amount of suspended solids was calculated by filtration through Millipore AP40 filters. Heavy metals in SPM were measured using the methodology of Loring and Rantala (1992): SPM was obtained by filtration using Nuclepore 0.4 μm polycarbonate filter membranes, dried, then decomposed in teflon bombs using aqua regia:HF, 1:1 v/v mixtures (Merck, Suprapur).</segment><segment>Composite sediment samples (3–4 grabs per sample) were collected at each of the 14 selected stations (Fig. 1) with a 0.025 m2 Van Veen grab. Only grabs that had achieved adequate penetration (2/3 of total volume) and that showed no evidence of leakage or surface disturbance were retained and the top 5 cm removed and transferred to a cooler. The contents of the cooler were homogenized with a teflon spoon until no color or textural differences could be detected. Then the coolers, chilled with ice, were transported to the laboratory. Sediment samples were maintained in the cooler at 4°C in the dark until processing and analysis, when the sediments were dried at 60°C and again gently homogenized. Sediment samples were totally digested following the method described by Loring and Rantala (1992): aqua regia:HF, 1:6 v/v mixtures (Merck, Suprapur).</segment><segment>To measure contamination in areas surrounding the Guadalquivir river, stations were selected in wetland areas along both left and right river margins, and water samples were collected as described above.</segment><segment>Prior to sample collection and between uses, all containers for the collection and storage of water, suspended solids and sediment samples were thoroughly cleaned with acid (10% HNO3), and then rinsed in ultrapure water (Milli-Q).</segment><segment>Concentrations of Zn, Cd, Pb and Cu in water, SPM and sediment were determined by differential pulse anodic stripping voltametry (DPASV). Measurements were taken with a hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE), using a Methrom 693 processor. The quantification of the metal concentration was performed using the standard addition procedure by means of standard solutions for each metal (Titrisol, Merck). Concentrations of Fe and Mn were determined by flame AAS. The analytical procedure for dissolved metals was checked using reference material CASS3 with an accuracy of ±10%. The analytical procedure for solid extracts was checked using reference material (MESS-1 NRC and CRM 277 BCR) and allow agreement with the certified values higher than 90%.</segment><segment>Speciation of metals in sediments was determined following the method proposed by Tessier et al. (1979). According to this method, five sequential extractions are carried out (F1, F2, F3, F4 and F5). The F1 includes metals associated with sediment in the most easily changeable. The F2 extract metals united mainly with carbonates and is highly sensible to changes in the pH. In the F3 extraction we obtain the metals bonded to Mn and Fe oxides. The F4 fraction the metals associated with the organic material and sulfides are released. Finally, in the F5 fraction we obtain the `residual&apos; or `lithogenic&apos; fraction, a portion of metals that are strongly bonded to the lithogenic minerals of the sediments. We have modified the exchangeable fraction (F1) according to Kestern and Förstner (1986) and the residual or lithogenic fraction (total) according to Loring and Rantala (1992). The F1 (exchangeable), F2 (carbonates) and F3 (Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides) fractions were acidified to avoid re-adsorption (Belzile et al., 1989). Also and separately for each station, the homogenized sediments were totally digested as described by Loring and Rantala (1992). Results are expressed as milligram per kilogram dry sediment for total analysis and as percentages for the speciation study. Percentage recovery was between 85% and 115% depending on the metal evaluated.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>The Consequences of the Oder Flood in 1997 on the Distribution of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the Oder River Estuary </title>
	<fulltext><segment>PAHs; contamination; water; fluffy layer; Oder River Estuary; Oder flood</segment><segment>The Oder is the fifth largest river feeding the Baltic Sea in terms of discharge and the largest in the south-western Baltic. It annually transports about 18 km3 of water from a highly industrialized drainage area of 119 000 km2 into the Oder Lagoon and from there via the three river branches Peenestrom (10%), Swina (80%) and Dziwna (10%) into the Pomeranian Bight of the Baltic Sea. The Oder River is one of the main sources of micropollutants in this region. In the summer of 1997 the drainage area was affected by an exceptional flood caused by two periods of heavy rainfall in July Fuchs and Rapp, 1997 and Siegel et al., 1998. In parts of southern Poland the rainfall rate in July was more than five times of the long-term monthly average.</segment><segment>These periods of intense precipitation induced the highest flood of the Oder River in the last 50 years with flow rates at Eisenhüttenstadt of up to 2500 m3/s (normally about 400 m3/s for this period). The flood reached the Oder Lagoon on July 20 (Rosenthal et al., 1998) and the Pomeranian Bight on July 28. Mohrholz et al. (1998) calculated a discharge of ∼9 km3 of river water into the Pomeranian Bight for the summer of 1997, 6.5 km3 more than the long-term average discharge for this season. In the Oder Lagoon, the flood waters affected mainly the eastern part of the lagoon, effectively diluting the high levels of suspended matter present there. The western part of the lagoon was not influenced by the flood water until approximately 12–14 August (Siegel and Gerth, 2000).</segment><segment>Because of the intensive industrial and urban activities in the catchment area and the normally with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) highly contaminated Oder water (Franke et al., 1998), it was expected that the flood water would carry high loads of contaminants and that the Baltic Sea or at least the Oder Lagoon and the Pomeranian Bight would be subjected to unusually elevated concentrations. The main objective of this paper is to describe the spreading of PAHs with the Oder flood plume in comparison to other seasons and years.</segment><segment>The water samples were collected between 25 and 31 July during a cruise of the R/V `Prof. Albrecht Penck&apos; in the Pomeranian Bight. The cruise was carried out by the Baltic Sea Research Institute to investigate the effect of the flood on the Pomeranian Bight. In addition, fluffy layer samples were collected from the R/V `Prof. Albrecht Penck&apos; and the R/V `A. v. Humboldt&apos; in the Oder Lagoon and the Arkona Sea during different seasons of 1997 including the Oder flood period. The locations of the stations are given in Fig. 1.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Sampling stations for the water and fluffy layer samples.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>The water samples were collected with 22 l spherical glass samplers. The extraction of the water sample (including both the particulate and the dissolved phase) was performed with 500 ml n-hexane directly in the sampler. The extraction efficiency of particle bound PAHs by this extraction method is high. The comparison between the liquid–liquid extraction and the in-situ pump technique (separate determination of PAHs in the water and particle phase) have lead to very similar results (Heemken, 1997). After separation of the extract and subsequent concentration to about 200 μl the PAH fraction was isolated by HPLC using a silicagel column (MERCK, LiChrospher Si 100-5) (Witt, 1995).</segment><segment>Additionally PAH composition were investigated in fluffy layer material. The fluffy layer is a near bottom layer of aggregates, mainly composed of organic substances and enriched in clay minerals, which are all preferred scavengers for nutrients, trace metals and organic micropollutants. It settles out of the water column under calm hydrographic conditions, only to be resuspended and transported along the bottom during storm events. The fluffy layer samples were collected by divers or with special sediment traps. The fluffy layer material was separated by centrifugation and stored at about −18°C in aluminium boxes until analysis. The samples were extracted with an accelerated soxhlet extraction system from DIONEX (ASE). The extraction was carried out twice with a mixture of n-hexane and acetone (9:1/v:v). After extraction the samples were pre-cleaned using solid phase extraction (5 g Al2O3 column, elution with 10 ml 50% n-hexane/CH2Cl2) followed by the HPLC clean up described above.</segment><segment>The PAHs samples were quantified using an iontrap GC/MS system (GCQ from THERMO QUEST). All samples were spiked with internal standard prior to the extraction (acenaphthene d10, phenanthrene d10, chrysene d12 and perylene d12). The analytical conditions are given in Table 1.</segment><segment>Table 1.

The mean recovery values ranged between 41% and 102% (details: Witt and Trost, 1999a). Because certified reference materials of PAHs in seawater are currently not available recovery studies were carried out in the sampler using 22 l of MilliQ water, which was spiked with external and internal standard solutions. The recovery values of the whole analytical procedure ranged between 39% and 92%.</segment><segment>The fluffy layer samples were normalized to total organic carbon (TOC). The TOC was measured with a C/S analyser (Metalyt CS 100 by ELTRA).</segment></fulltext>

	<title>A Marine Biotic Index to Establish the Ecological Quality of Soft-Bottom Benthos Within European Estuarine and Coastal Environments </title>
	<fulltext><segment>biotic index; ecological quality; diversity; benthos; soft-bottom; European coastal environments</segment><segment>Marine environmental quality control is undertaken usually by means of monitoring different parameters in water, sediment and sentinel organisms (i.e. Mussel Watch), as in the USA (O’Connor, 1992), France (RNO, 1998) or Great Britain (Franklin and Jones, 1994). This control is centred on physico-chemical and ecotoxicological variables and, less usually, on biological variables. Dauer (1993) stated that biological criteria are considered important components of water quality because: (i) they are direct measures of the condition of the biota, (ii) they may uncover problems undetected or underestimated by other methods; and (iii) such criteria provide measurements of the progress of restoration efforts.</segment><segment>New European rules (see Directive Proposal 1999/C 343/01, Official Journal of the European Communities 30/11/1999) emphasize the importance of biological indicators, in order to establish the ecological quality of European coasts and estuaries. Benthic invertebrates are used frequently as bio-indicators of marine monitoring, because various studies have demonstrated that macrobenthos responds relatively rapidly to anthropic and natural stress Pearson and Rosenberg, 1978 and Dauer, 1993.</segment><segment>River ecology has an established long tradition in applying macrobenthos as bio-indicators; likewise some biotic indices have been proposed Woodiwiss, 1964, Cairns et al., 1968, Chandler, 1970 and ISO-BMWP, 1979. On the other hand, some attempts to provide useful `tools&apos; to measure ecological quality in the marine environment have been developed in Europe and North America Hily, 1984, Majeed, 1987, Dauer, 1993, Grall and Glémarec, 1997 and Weisberg et al., 1997.</segment><segment>All the aforementioned studies utilize soft-bottom communities to construct the indices, because macrobenthic animals are relatively sedentary (and cannot avoid deteriorating water/sediment quality conditions), have relatively long life-spans (thus, indicate and integrate water/sediment quality conditions, with time), consist of different species that exhibit different tolerances to stress and have an important role in cycling nutrients and materials between the underlying sediments and the overlying water column Hily, 1984 and Dauer, 1993.</segment><segment>In this contribution, a marine Biotic Index (BI) is designed to establish the ecological quality of European coasts. This explores the response of soft-bottom communities to natural and man-induced changes in water quality, integrating long-term environmental conditions.</segment><segment>The Department of Land Action, Housing and Environment of the Basque Government has established a network of monitoring stations along the Basque coast-line (North of Spain). This provides water, sediment and biological quality information from 30 sampling stations (Fig. 1). The benthic sampling has been carried out every February, from 1995 to 1998 using the research vessel `Ortze&apos;.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Position of the 30 stations monitored along the Basque coast-line (North of Spain), from 1995 to 1998. The stations used to validate the model are shown in black.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>At each of these stations, three replicates of benthos were collected with a Van Veen grab (1215 cm2). The samples were filtered immediately, using a sieve of mesh size of 1 mm and fixed in a solution of 4% formalin (Holme and McIntyre, 1971).</segment><segment>At each station, a sediment sample was obtained to determine redox potential, organic matter content and contaminant levels (heavy metals and organic compounds). The redox potential was measured, on board, by means of an Orion 977800 platinum electrode which was connected to a Crison 501 pH-meter-milivoltimeter.</segment><segment>A 200 g sediment sample was dried at 80°C for 24 h, then it was washed with freshwater on a mesh of 63 μm. The dried residue was sieved on a column of eight sieves (size 31 μm to 4 mm). The percentages of gravel, sand and mud were calculated as: &gt;2 mm fraction, 63 μm – 2 mm and &lt;63 μm, respectively (Holme and McIntyre, 1971).</segment><segment>The organic matter content was calculated by the loss on ignition method: drying at 105°C, 24 h; then combusting at 520°C, 6 h (Kristensen and Anderson, 1993).</segment><segment>Metal concentrations (As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn) were analysed on the &lt;63 μm fraction. Extraction was made first with nitric acid, during 15 h, at ambient temperature; and second, with nitric and hydrochloric acids (1:3 in volume), using a microwave oven (130 W, 4 min; 0 W, 1.5 min; 250 W, 5 min; 0 W, 2 min; 400 W, 4 min). Detection was made by atomic absorption, using flame, graphite furnace and cold vapour techniques. The analytical procedure was checked with reference material (BCR marine sediment-harbour PACS-1); differences with this material were lower than 10%.</segment><segment>For PCB (eight congeners), DDT and HCH determination a portion of the original sample was desiccated with anhydrous sodium sulphate and extraction was made with iso-octane, after conditioning and clean-up of the extract the analysis was made with an HP-5890 gas chromatograph. On the other hand, for PAH (10 compounds) determination, the extraction was made with ether, and the analysis was made by means of HPLC.</segment><segment>The mean bottom oxygen concentration was measured with a CTD Sea-Bird 25, or with a portable YSI-55 oxymeter. Salinity was measured with the same CTD, or with a Kahlsico SR10 induction salinometer.</segment><segment>The identification was undertaken in the laboratory by means of a binocular microscope (4–40×). After computing the mean abundance of each taxon, at each sampling station, the macrobenthic community structure was described calculating the following descriptors (Washington, 1984): richness (number of identified taxa); abundance (N: ind m−2); numerical diversity (Shannon Wiener H′n: bits ind−1); biomass (Dry Weight, B: g m−2); and biomass diversity (Shannon Wiener H′b: bits g−1).</segment><segment>The model here developed is based on that first used by Glémarec and Hily (1981) and then by Hily (1984), which utilizes soft-bottom benthos to construct a BI.</segment><segment>Soft-bottom macrobenthic communities respond to environmental stress (i.e. the introduction of organic matter in the system) by means of different adaptive strategies. Gray (1979) summarizes these strategies into three ecological groups: r (r-selected: species with short life-span, fast growth, early sexual maturation and larvae throughout the year); k (k-selected: species with relatively long life, slow growth and high biomass); and T (stress tolerant: species not affected by alterations).</segment><segment>Salen-Picard (1983) has proposed four progressive steps relating to stressed environments: (i) initial state (in an unpolluted situation, there is a rich biocenosis in individuals and species, with exclusive species and high diversity); (ii) slight unbalance (regression of exclusive species, proliferation of tolerant species, the appearance of pioneering species, decrease of diversity); (iii) pronounced unbalance (population dominated by pollution indicators, very low diversity); and (iv) azoic substrata.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Bleaching Damage and Recovery Potential of Maldivian Coral Reefs </title>
	<fulltext><segment>atolls; bleaching; coral recruitment and mortality; disturbance; El Niño; Maldives</segment><segment>During the last two decades coral reefs have experienced an increase in the number of environmental disturbances associated with global-level changes in temperature and light Glynn, 1991, Goreau and Hayes, 1994, Brown, 1997a, Brown, 1997b and Goreau et al., 2000. Many recent changes in reefs have been associated with localized phenomenon of nutrification Tomascik and Sanders, 1987, Lapointe et al., 1997, Lapointe, 1997 and Green et al., 1997, diseases (Aronson and Precht, 1997), and heavy fishing Hughes, 1994 and McClanahan et al., 1999, but investigators have also reported large ecological changes from remote areas or areas with low levels of human influence, such as remote islands and reef atolls Glynn, 1994, Allison, 1996, McClanahan and Muthiga, 1998, Sheppard, 1999a, Sheppard, 1999b and Sheppard, 2000a. Ecological changes in these remote areas are more likely to have a global rather than local cause, and are, therefore, instructive in distinguishing local from global factors that influence reef ecology. Coral reefs of the Maldive-Chagos ridge are one of the areas with the lowest human influences in the western Indian Ocean (McClanahan et al., 2000) and, therefore, changes in these reefs are a likely indicator of global change.</segment><segment>One of the most recent global-level disturbances to coral reefs was the 1997–1998 El Niño event Strong et al., 1998, McPhaden, 1999, Wilkinson et al., 1999 and Goreau et al., 2000. The Maldive–Chagos region is historically the warmest region of the Indian Ocean (Rosen, 1971), and satellite records also indicate that the warmest temperature anomalies in 1997–1998 were in this area of the north-western Indian Ocean, with temperatures exceeding 31°C, and anomalies of +1–3°C sustained over two years Wilkinson et al., 1999 and Goreau et al., 2000. This warm water was associated with widespread bleaching of scleractinian corals and mortality between May and September 1998 (Allison, W., Clarke, S., Sluka, R., pers. comm.). This large-scale warming probably represents one of the biggest large-scale disturbances to coral reefs in recent history (Strong et al., 1998; Goreau et al., 2000; ISRS Statement on Bleaching). The outcome of these temperature fluctuations is of concern to the future of coral reefs as they may be indicative of future climate patterns associated with global warming Glynn, 1991, Glynn, 1993 and Brown and Ogden, 1993.</segment><segment>This study examines the status of Maldivian coral reefs by comparing their current state with earlier surveys of Maldivian reefs undertaken by Scheer (1971) in 1958, Davies et al. (1971), in 1964, and Allison (1995) in the early 1992. In 1992, Allison (1995) repeated surveys of some sites studied by Scheer (1971) and Davies et al. (1971), and found a large reduction in coral cover, particularly the branching species. Allison (1995) attributes these changes to coral bleaching associated with elevated temperature in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This study reports on the status of a larger and more dispersed sampling of sites, in the middle atolls of the Maldives, to determine the possible spatial extent of Allison&apos;s (1995) reported changes and to determine the status of these reefs after the 1997–1998 El Niño.</segment><segment>The Maldives is a ∼700 km long chain of 26 atolls, having ∼1200 coral reef islands (only ∼200 are inhabited). The islands have one of the lowest levels of human influence on coral reefs in the western Indian Ocean due to the oceanic location (having a total land area of only 186 km2 of which 80% is &lt;1 m above sea level) and the Maldivian cultural habits of eating pelagic tunas rather than reef fishes Sheppard and Wells, 1988, McClanahan et al., 2000 and Risk and Sluka, 2000. This unique environment has produced a highly successful beach and dive tourism industry over the past three decades that has largely reduced fishing as the main economic resource for these islands (Price and Firaq, 1996). The reefs are, therefore, relatively undisturbed by resource extraction and nutrification, with the exception of resort diver and snorkeler influences Allison, 1996 and Price and Firaq, 1996, coral mining (Brown and Dunne, 1988; Dawson-Sheppard, 1992; Clark and Edwards, 1995), shark fishing, money cowry, aquarium fish and sea cucumber collection (Adam et al., 1997), the live grouper trade (Sluka, 1998), and nutrification from the capital city, Malè (Risk et al., 1994). A survey of divers employed by resorts (Price and Firaq, 1996) suggested that reef condition was good, but decreases with the age of the tourist resort and increased with distance from the densely populated capital, Malè.</segment><segment>Maldivian reefs, along with the Chagos, are among the warmest and most species-rich reefs in the western Indian Ocean Rosen, 1971 and Sheppard, 2000b. Sheppard (2000b) lists 187 species among 57 genera of hard corals for the Maldives which is only second to neighboring Chagos. Nine hundred species of shallow-water fishes have been recorded (Randall and Anderson, 1993). Coral bleaching has been reported on these reefs during the late 1980s and early 1990s Allison, 1995 and Price and Firaq, 1996, with a large bleaching event in 1997–1998 (Allison, W., Clarke, S., Sluka, R., pers. comm.).</segment><segment>The most complete study of Maldivian corals was completed by Scheer (1971) in 1957–1958 who described corals in 5 m × 5 m quadrats in 25 Maldivian sites, most of them on the southern most Addu atoll, but also on Ari and Fadiffolu Atolls (Fig. 1). He also recorded the number of genera found on these and Rasdu and Gaha Faro atolls. Davies et al. (1971) report some supplementary data collected in 1964 on coral cover and species distributions based on two transects off the island of Gan on Addu Atoll. Allison (1995) repeated some of the same study sites as Scheer (1971) and Davies et al. (1971) in 1992. This study adds additional study sites in the central Maldives to determine if the loss or low coral cover reported by Allison (1995) was widespread.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Bioerosion of Live Massive Corals and Branching Coral Rubble on Indonesian Coral Reefs </title>
	<fulltext><segment>bioerosion; eutrophication; Indonesia; coral reefs; rapid reef assessment</segment><segment>Bioerosion is a key process limiting rates and patterns of coral reef growth Goreau and Hartman, 1963 and Hutchings and Bamber, 1985. Increased bioerosion in response to nutrient availability may limit reef accretion, possibly contributing to reef death, or reef drowning during sea level rise Hallock and Schlager, 1986, Hallock, 1988 and Glynn, 1997. The most common method of assessing bioerosion intensity (but not rates) on modern coral reefs is to measure the area removed from cross-sections of corals, either in X-rays (e.g. Sammarco and Risk, 1990) or photographs (e.g. Risk et al., 1995). These techniques are costly and time-consuming, frequently require computer image analysis equipment not readily available in the developing world, and, most significantly, require killing live corals. Alternatively, experimental methods using blocks of coral skeleton (e.g. Kiene and Hutchings, 1994, Chazottes et al., 1995 and Pari et al., 1998) or calcite (e.g. Kobluk and Risk, 1977) require long experimental periods and are not suitable for surveys or rapid assessment.</segment><segment>Land-based sources of pollution pose great threats to coral reefs worldwide (Pastorak and Bilyard, 1985), especially in Indonesia Edinger et al., 1998 and Edinger et al., (2000), home to about one-seventh of the world’s coral reefs (Tomascik et al., 1997), and the centre of world global coral species biodiversity Veron, 1993 and Wallace, 1997. One of the principle ways in which nutrient pollution threatens coral reefs is by increasing bioerosion intensity Risk and MacGeachy, 1978, Rose and Risk, 1985, Hallock and Schlager, 1986, Hutchings, 1986, Glynn, 1997, Szmant, 1997 and Pari et al., 1998.</segment><segment>Bioerosion is a key process of carbonate destruction in coral reef carbonate budgets Stearn et al., 1977, Scoffin et al., 1980 and Hubbard et al., 1990, which provide an integrated, whole-reef perspective on coral reef health McClanahan, 1997 and Edinger et al., (2000). Barbados reefs were the site of the first major comprehensive study of reef carbonate budgets Stearn et al., 1977 and Scoffin et al., 1980. Eutrophication was later shown to be a major cause of coral reef degradation along the west coast of Barbados Tomascik and Sander, 1985, Tomascik and Sander, 1987a and Tomascik and Sander, 1987b. Subsequent studies of coral rubble along this eutrophication gradient revealed an increased abundance of bioeroding sponges in more eutrophic environments (Holmes, 1997).</segment><segment>Holmes (1997) study has been modified here to develop a non-destructive rapid reef assessment (RRA) technique for indicating eutrophication stress on coral reefs. RRA techniques form an increasingly important part of the reef survey toolbox Risk and Risk, 1997 and Jamieson et al., 1998. This rubble bioerosion technique may be suitable as a general measure of pollution stress on coral reefs (sensu Thomascik and Sander, 1987a), along with stomatopods (Erdmann and Caldwell, 1997), butterflyfish (Reese, 1993, but see also Erdmann, 1997), and stable isotope geochemistry Risk et al., 1993, Lazier, 1997 and Heikoop et al., 2000.</segment><segment>Here, the intensity of bioerosion on Indonesian reefs along eutrophication gradients is assessed using the rubble technique along with slabbing and X-raying coral heads. The two data sets provide a comprehensive view of bioerosion processes on some of the world’s most imperiled coral reefs Tomascik et al., 1993, Chou, 1997 and Tomascik et al., 1997 and allow a comparison of the two techniques.</segment><segment>Our two study areas, in the Java Sea and around Ambon, an island in the Moluccas in the Banda Sea, represent considerably different environments. The Java Sea Reefs are all coral cays in an onshore-offshore sequence, and span a wide gradient of nutrient levels and sedimentation rates. By contrast, the Ambon reefs are all fringing reefs surrounding high island, which has a high population density concentrated around Ambon Bay. Only one of these reefs is isolated and relatively unaffected by anthropogenic factors; the others are affected by a range of human activities including construction damage, sewage pollution, and plywood factory effluent Limmon, 1996 and Edinger et al., 1998.</segment><segment>Bioerosion of live massive coral and of rubble from branching corals were measured on a total of nine reefs from the two regions. Bioerosion levels are compared here with environmental variables and reef health parameters derived from line transect reef surveys (Edinger et al., 1998). Five hypotheses are tested:</segment><segment>1.Bioerosion of live massive corals is correlated with chlorophyll concentration and other environmental variables indicative of eutrophication.2.Bioerosion of branching coral rubble is correlated with chlorophyll concentration and other environmental variables indicative of eutrophication.3.Bioerosion of live massive corals is correlated with reef health parameters derived from transect data.4.Coral rubble bioerosion is correlated with reef health parameters derived from transect data.5.Bioerosion levels in coral rubble can provide a reliable measure of overall eutrophication stress.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Screening of Mercury and Persistent Organochlorine Pollutants in Long-Finned Pilot Whale (Globicephala melas) in the Faroe Islands </title>
	<fulltext><segment>mammals; pollution monitoring; halogenated hydrocarbons; Globicephala melas; mercury; PCB</segment><segment>The muscle and blubber from the long-finned pilot whale Globicephala melas is a much favoured traditional food source in the Faroe Islands. The annual catch of pilot whales averages 850 individuals a year, the hunt is a drive fishery with a negligible effect on the population Bloch et al., 1990 and NAMMCO, 1998 A detailed description of the catch of a pod of whales and handling of the whales is given by Bloch et al. (1990), and according to practice named a `grind&apos; (Butterworth, 1993).</segment><segment>An international research programme on the ecology and status of the long-finned pilot whale off the Faroe Islands was performed from 1986 to 1988, where 3470 individuals from 40 grinds were thoroughly examined. This project represents to date the most comprehensive study with the largest sample size, illustrating many different aspects of the biology of a small odontocete species. The basic results appeared in Donovan et al. (1993) and an overview of the work was compiled by Desportes et al. (1992).</segment><segment>A high concentration of mercury in pilot whales was found in the Faroe Islands in 1977 Kraul et al., 1977 and Bloch and Hoydal, 1987. The Faroese health authorities have since advised to limit the consumption of meat to once or twice a week. Later, in the early 1980s, the large content of pesticides was found and advice was given to restrict the consumption also of the whaleblubber Andersen et al., 1987, Bloch and Hoydal, 1987, Julshamn et al., 1987 and Julshamn et al., 1989. A large number of pilot whales were analysed for mercury as well as some of the persistent organic contaminants (polychlorinated biphenyls and pesticides such as DDT) in the 1986–1988 study Schintu et al., 1992, Aguilar et al., 1993, Borrell, 1993, Borrell and Aguilar, 1993, Caurant and Navarro, 1994, Borrell et al., 1995, Caurant and Amiard-Triquet, 1995, Caurant et al., 1993, Caurant et al., 1994 and Caurant et al., 1996. The Faroese consumers of pilot whales were reported to carry higher body burdens of mercury than for instance the Norwegian population Julshamn et al., 1989 and Jean-Caurant and Amiard-Triquet, 1991. Faroese children born 1986–1987, and their mothers, have been followed to study adverse effects of mercury transferred from the mothers to the offspring during pregnancy and early childhood, a phenomenon found in the pilot whales themselves Caurant, 1994 and Caurant and Navarro, 1994. The main results were published in 1997 Grandjean et al., 1992, Grandjean et al., 1995a, Grandjean et al., 1995b, Grandjean et al., 1997 and Weihe et al., 1996. At the same time it was decided to make a screening of the pollutants in whales caught in 1997, the results of this are presented here.</segment><segment>The transfer of maternal persistent organic pollutant load to the offspring during gestation and through lactation was studied from pilot whales sampled in 1987 (Borrell et al., 1995) and this offloading of pollutants (PCB, DDT) which begins after attained sexual maturity was earlier reported for short-finned pilot whales (Tanabe et al., 1987) as an inversely related age vs pollutant concentration curve. No clear relation between age vs pollutant concentration was found for the males and immature females. Borrell et al. (1995) showed, as later was shown for human mothers, that the highest loads were transferred from the primiparous females, whereas the transfer decreases in successive gestation and lactation cycles Skaare and Polder, 1990 and Jensen, 1996. It was found that the transfer of PCB and DDTs were proportional to the body burden of the mother and resulted in a net decrease in her blubber concentration. Hence, in later pregnancies the initial load in the female blubber is less, and less pollutants are transferred. The new-born therefore contained variable but high pollutant concentrations. The load of the organochlorinated pollutants thus decreases with increasing age in females, whereas in males the contamination niveau increases throughout their lives (Borrell et al., 1995). The pilot whales were therefore pooled in three groups: (1) adult males, (2) adult females and (3) juveniles of both sexes.</segment><segment>Tissue samples of 50 long-finned pilot whales were ideally taken from every grind, the actual number was determined by the pod size. The selection of the sampled individuals was random in the sense that there were made no guidelines as to what animal should be included. In 1997 samples were taken from 417 pilot whales ( Table 1) at various locations (Fig. 1) out of a yearly total of 1162 caught in 15 pods. The number of juvenile and sexually mature males and females are given in the table, both in number of individuals and in the special Faroese weight value, named skinn. The weight of `one skinn pilot whale&apos; is on average 34 kg of blubber and 38 kg of meat, and a thoroughly explanation of the value `Skinn&apos; and its biological correlations with total body length, weight and sexual maturity is treated by Bloch and Zachariassen, 1989, Bloch, 1994 and Bloch, 1996, and Bloch and Lastein (1995). Inclusion of the skinn values is an easy way to express the actual mass of the whales to trasfer the content of pollutants from whale to consumers.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Concentration of Chlorinated Hydrocarbons and Heavy Metals in Alaska Arctic Marine Mammals </title>
	<fulltext><segment>Alaska-Arctic; cetaceans; marine mammals; chlorinated hydrocarbons; chlorinated pesticides; heavy metals; pinnipeds; polychlorinated biphenyls</segment><segment>Marine mammals are long-lived, most species (but not all) are top predators, and most maintain large energy reserves in the form of subcutaneous body fat (for pinnipeds and cetaceans this is known as blubber). Based on these three factors alone, it is not surprising that relatively high levels of potentially toxic substances that bioaccumulate have been routinely reported in marine mammals since the early 1970s. These substances have included lipophilic organochlorine compounds (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), DDT and its metabolites, chlorobenzenes, hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), dieldrin, endrin, mirex, chlordane, and toxaphene) as well as potentially toxic trace elements (e.g., mercury, cadmium, and lead).</segment><segment>Compared to most terrestrial mammals, small cetaceans and seals appear to have a lower capacity to metabolize and excrete lipophilic organochlorine compounds. Metabolic capacity might be even lower in odontocetes (toothed whales) than in pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) (Tanabe et al., 1988). The lipid reserve of a marine mammal represents a large reservoir for accumulating lipophilic compounds. Its potential for living a relatively long time suggests that it has the capacity for accumulating substances to relatively high levels and its role as a top predator (for seals, sea lions, odontocetes, and polar bears) indicates that it has the potential for being exposed to relatively high levels of substances that may accumulate in the lower trophic levels (e.g., chlorinated hydrocarbons, methylmercury, cadmium, etc.). This leads to questions regarding the effect of high contaminants loads on the health of the marine mammals. Some populations associated with highly contaminated environments have shown disease symptoms or reduced reproductive capacity Helle, 1980, Reijnders, 1986, Martineau et al., 1988, Béland et al., 1993, Martineau et al., 1994, Olsson et al., 1994, DeGuise et al., 1995 and Ross et al., 1996. Within the last decade, there has been an increased interest in studying contaminants in marine mammals due to large-scale die-offs of some pinnipeds and odontocetes in Europe and North America, and the finding of relatively large anthropogenic contaminant burdens in these animals. In all cases, direct cause-effect links between contaminant burdens and death have not been established; however, a synergistic role of such substances in increasing the susceptibility of affected animals to disease organisms and biotoxins has not been discounted.</segment><segment>Due to the lack of large industrial and agricultural areas and no large human population centers, one might expect that those marine mammals that are restricted to the Arctic would have relatively low levels of contaminants. This is generally the case for lipophilic compounds. In the case of potentially toxic elements, such as cadmium and mercury, this not so clear. Also, a major factor to consider in the importance of contaminants in Arctic marine mammals is the special role this group of animals plays as subsistence food for the indigenous human residents of the Arctic coasts. Such a resource has been utilized for thousands of years. In Alaska, the bowhead whale, Balaenamysticetus, is a major food resource as well as a major cultural heritage resource for the coastal villages of the Beaufort and Chukchi seas and the villages on St. Lawrence Island and Little Diomede islands in the northern Bering Sea. The Pacific walrus, Odobenusrosmarusdivergens, is a major food resource for the residents of St. Lawrence and Little Diomede islands, as well as in important food for coastal villages from the Chukchi Sea and the northern and central Bering Sea. Other important marine mammal food resources of the Alaska Arctic include: beluga whale, Delphinapterusleucas, bearded seal, Erignathusbarbatus, ringed seal, Phocahispida, and spotted seal, P. largha. Other species occur in what is considered to be the Alaska Arctic (Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering seas) but migrate annually into the lower latitudes of the North Pacific (some as far as southern California and west to the waters off Japan) and, therefore, represent animals that are directly exposed to contaminants generated in those latitudes. Some of these species that are also used for human subsistence food include: the northern fur seal, Callorhinusursinus, Steller Sea Lion, Eumatopiasjubatus, harbor seal, P. vitulina, and to a lesser extent gray whale, Eschrichtiusrobustus.</segment><segment>In addition to individual researchers, several programs have recently begun to investigate the levels of anthropogenic contaminants in Alaska marine mammals. The programs, which have emphasized chlorinated hydrocarbons and heavy metals, include: the Alaska Marine Mammal Tissue Archival Project (AMMTAP), sponsored by the US Geological Survey Biological Resources Division (USGS/BRD) for the Minerals Management Service, the Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program, sponsored by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a polar bear monitoring study being conducted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service’s Office of Marine Mammals Management, studies of radionuclides conducted by NOAA as part of the Office of Naval Research’s sponsored study-Status and Fate of Radionuclides in Arctic Marine Ecosystems, and the Project: Human and Chemical Ecology of Arctic Pathways by Marine Pollutants. This last project is funded by the Cooperative Institute for Arctic Research, and is being conducted jointly by the Barrow Arctic Science Consortium, the Arctic Institute of North America, Environment Canada, and the North Slope Borough Department of Wildlife Management.</segment><segment>The AMMTAP, which began in 1987 and which is described by Becker et al. (1993), is now conducted as part of the Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program as a collaboration between USGS/BRD, NMFS, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This national program, described by Lillestolen et al. (1993) and Becker et al. (1994), was established by an amendment to the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The program includes: (1) the development of an environmental contaminants database for all marine mammal species from US waters; (2) the maintenance of an environmental tissue bank for research purposes; (3) the conduct of a quality assurance and quality control program for chemical analysis of tissues; and (4) the development and maintenance of national system of stranding network volunteers to respond to marine mammal strandings. The AMMTAP forms the Alaska `arm&apos; of this national program. The AMMTAP is collaborating with the US Fish and Wildlife Service in its studies on contaminants in polar bears, with Environment Canada (formerly with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada) in its studies on beluga whales and ringed seals, and with local and State organizations, such as the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the North Slope Borough Department of Wildlife Management, and the Natural Resources Division of Kawerak, in their studies of marine mammals. The work is also conducted in cooperation with various Alaska native groups, groups that can be directly affected by the results. These include such organizations as: the North Slope Borough Fish and Game Committee, the Alaska Beluga Whale Committee, the Eskimo Walrus Commission, and the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission.</segment><segment>Review of past studies of contaminants in marine mammals indicate that the organs and tissues most commonly collected for analysis are subcutaneous storage fat (blubber), liver, and kidney. Other organs include muscle, heart, bone, skin, and brain. Blubber is generally selected since it represents the largest lipid reservoir and the tissue which most commonly has the highest concentrations of lipophilic substances. It is, however, not a target organ, i.e., an organ likely to have its function affected. Target organs for lipophilic compounds include liver, kidney, gonads, endrocrine glands, and brain. Liver is commonly selected as an organ for analysis of both lipophilic compounds and heavy metals and, in the case of heavy metals, the kidney is usually collected as a supplemental organ along with liver for the measurement of heavy metals. The liver is a major detoxification site for contaminants; therefore, it is a suitable organ for enzyme and metabolite analyses. It also has sufficient lipid content for accumulation of organic as well as inorganic substances.</segment><segment>Certain organs and tissues tend to be selective for the accumulation of heavy metals, e.g., bone for lead, kidney for cadmium, liver for inorganic mercury, muscle and brain for methylmercury, and bone and fat for vanadium. Brain is not routinely sampled, since this tissue-type is usually not as easily removed from the animal as is body cavity organs or blubber. It also tends to deteriorate rapidly after death of the animal; therefore, acquiring good quality fresh samples is difficult. The brain is considered a target organ for many chlorinated pesticides, methylmercury, and lead. The brain also has a much different lipid makeup than lipid storage depots, such as blubber. Brain tissue consists primarily of phospholipid and cholesterol, which are much more polar in nature than the lipids found in visceral fat and blubber and, therefore, tend to select for the accumulation of the more polar chlorinated hydrocarbons and the more polar isomers of these compounds.</segment><segment>The largest database on contaminants in Alaska marine mammals exist for PCBs, DDT and its metabolites (DDD and DDE), dieldrin, endrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), HCH, total mercury and cadmium. The reporting of congener-specific PCB measurements is now routine. Other chlorinated hydrocarbons being recently measured are chlordane compounds, HCH isomers (α-, β-, and γ-HCH), and toxaphene. The number of chlordane compounds reported varies based on the individual researcher and the analytical techniques used. This makes it frequently difficult to compare chlordane values among investigations. Measurement of toxaphene compounds (polychlorinated bornanes) continues to be problematic, also making it difficult to compare values generated by more than one investigator. Data on dioxins and furans in Alaska marine mammals is non-existent.</segment><segment>The increase in the number of contaminant compounds being measured in Alaska marine mammals reflects the improvement in analytical techniques. There is also a greater appreciation for the necessity of obtaining clean fresh samples, following standard procedures for sampling and sample handling, and for using good quality assurance – quality control procedures during analysis. In many situations, this also makes it difficult for comparing present results with past data.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>The Use of Cholinesterase Activity in Flounder (Platichthys flesus) Muscle Tissue as a Biomarker of Neurotoxic Contamination in UK Estuaries </title>
	<fulltext><segment>cholinesterase (AChE, BChE); neurotoxicity; flounder (Platichthys flesus); organophosphate and carbamate pesticides; estuaries; monitoring</segment><segment>The estuarine environment is unique in comparison to other water bodies, due to the physico-chemical dynamism associated with the mixing of fresh and marine waters. These characteristics have resulted in the development of rich and diverse ecological systems which are potentially under threat as they act as the conduit for a wide range of anthropogenic inputs to the marine environment from terrestrial and riverine sources. It is known that many UK estuaries are contaminated with a wide range of pollutants including: metals (Laslett, 1995), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) (Law et al., 1997), pesticides (MAFF, 1995), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (CEFAS, 1997) and surfactants (Blackburn and Waldock, 1995). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that these contaminants can exist at potentially harmful concentrations in the water Matthiessen et al., 1993 and Kirby et al., 1998 and more especially in sediments (Matthiessen et al., 1998a).</segment><segment>Conventional bioassay methods and chemical analysis techniques have permitted the assessment of the concentrations of specific pollutants in water and sediment and the potential biological effects of these on factors such as survival, growth and reproduction. However, the need to detect and assess the effects of contamination at low concentrations and in complex mixtures has led to the development of a wide range of sub-lethal indicators of exposure to, and effects of, contaminants and other environmental stressors (Livingstone et al., 1997). These indicators are collectively referred to as `biomarkers&apos; and can be either specific (monitoring for the presence/effects of specific chemical classes) or general.</segment><segment>The extent of estuarine contamination and its possible effects on estuarine organisms has been investigated using a number of techniques including fish abundance fluctuations (Pomfret et al., 1991), disease occurrence in fish (Vethaak and Jol., 1996) and the acute toxicity of water (Kirby et al., 1998) and sediment (Matthiessen et al., 1998a). However, these approaches are relatively insensitive and whilst they offer important tools for looking at integrated effects they do not offer the diagnostic ability to investigate potential problems caused by specific contaminant classes. Certain biomarker techniques offer a more focussed approach; metallothionein for metals (Sulaiman et al., 1991), plasma vitellogenin for oestrogenic substances Lye et al., 1997, Allen et al., 1997, Allen et al., 1999 and Matthiessen et al., 1998b and ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD) induction for PAH/PCBs (Kirby et al., 1999b).</segment><segment>Pesticides have been highlighted as important estuarine contaminants (Matthiessen, 1988). The use of most organochlorine pesticides has been restricted in recent years due to their environmental persistence and this has led to a great increase in the use of organophosphate (OP) and carbamate (C) alternatives (Ceron et al., 1996). Although less persistent than their predecessors, they are generally more toxic and have been responsible for fish kills in the past (Zinkl et al., 1991). Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides are potent neurotoxins and exert their toxicity by blocking the breakdown of acetylcholine (ACh) by the enzyme, acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Acetylcholine is the primary neurotransmitter in the sensory and neuromuscular systems of fish. The activity of this system is vital to normal behaviour and muscular function (Payne et al., 1996) and it represents a prime target on which some toxicants can realize a detrimental effect. The levels of ACh at a neuro-junction must be carefully regulated, and this role is fulfiled by the enzyme AChE, which degrades the ACh into the inactive products choline and acetic acid. These are reabsorbed and used as raw materials for the continued production of ACh. Inhibition of the AChE enzyme will result in a build up of ACh causing a continuous and excessive stimulation of the nerve/muscle fibres which will result in tetany, paralysis and eventual death.</segment><segment>Organophosphate and carbamate pesticides have the potential to exhibit neurotoxic activity at low concentrations. Zinkl et al. (1991) cite examples of median lethal concentrations of OPs (parathion and azinphos-methyl) to fish as low as 10 μg l−1 and sub-lethal effects on olfactory function in Atlantic salmon, which is essential in normal endocrine and reproductive activity, were discovered for the OP diazinon at concentrations as low as 1 μg l−1(Moore and Waring, 1996). Chemical analysis of surface waters in estuaries and rivers has shown concentrations of fenitrothion up to 0.3 μg l−1(House et al., 1997), and Virtue and Church (1993) reported short-term peaks of the OP diazinon as high as 200 μg l−1. It is possible that these pesticides in combination are present in UK estuaries at levels causing toxic effects. The degradation of OPs and Cs is relatively rapid (Ferrando et al., 1992) and their persistence in the environment is thought to be relatively short (Murty and Ramani, 1992), and so toxic concentrations are thought to be transient. However, it is also possible that continuous seasonal inputs, which could occur in estuarine environments, could maintain semi-stable concentrations at neurotoxic levels. Furthermore, surveys of fish muscle AChE levels along a pollution gradient in the North Sea (Galgani et al., 1992a) and in marine environments associated with effluents in Canada (Payne et al., 1996) provide strong evidence that significant suppression of neural activity is occurring in some areas.</segment><segment>This study was designed to ascertain whether evidence of neurotoxicity was apparent in UK estuaries using the measurement of ChE activity in flounder (Platichthys flesus) muscle. Flounder is an estuarine/coastal species that resides for the majority of the year in estuaries, only migrating to deeper water in the winter months (Hylland et al., 1996), and as such it represents a sentinel for medium-term exposure. Its relative abundance and broad geographical distribution qualify it as a good target species for biological effects monitoring, and its suitability for such applications has been endorsed by Goksøyr et al. (1996). A closely related species, dab (Limanda limanda), has been used previously to monitor the presence of marine neurotoxicity Galgani et al., 1992b and Bocquené et al., 1993. Although ChE activity has previously been measured in the European flounder before Stieger et al., 1989 and Sturm et al., 1999, this appears to be the first time that this species has been used for the environmental monitoring of ChE inhibition.</segment><segment>Chemical analysis of estuarine water from representative sites in the estuaries of the Alde, Humber, Mersey, Tamar, Tees and Tyne was also undertaken for a range of OP and C pesticides in an attempt to link the ChE levels observed to the presence of these potent neurotoxic contaminants. In total, 32 OP and 20 C compounds were selected for analysis on the basis of their scale of use in the UK.</segment><segment>The positions of the estuaries sampled are shown in Fig. 1. Sufficient flounder (&gt;4) were caught at 16 sites from seven estuaries. The fish were captured using 2–3 m beam trawls deployed from Environment Agency research vessels in the period September to December 1997. Trawls were towed at 3–4 knots for 20–30 min so as to minimize stress to the catch. At most sites 3–8 tows were required to obtain a satisfactory sample. The estuary of the River Alde on the Suffolk coast was chosen as the control or reference site as, unlike the other estuaries sampled, it is essentially free from industrial inputs, and only has two small (&lt;1000 m3 d−1) sewage treatment works discharging to the estuary. A full list of sampling locations is given in Table 1.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>The Effects of a Small Sewage Outfall on an Algal Epifaunal Community at Macquarie Island (sub-Antarctic): A Drop in the Southern Ocean? </title>
	<fulltext><segment>epifauna; sewage outfall; intertidal; impacts; sub-Antarctic</segment><segment>There is growing recognition that the historical presence of humans in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions has resulted in impacts in both terrestrial and marine habitats. Although some of these impacts have resulted from single incidents of pollution such as oil spills (Nella Dan – Pople et al., 1991; Simpson et al., 1995, Smith and Simpson, 1995 and Smith and Simpson, 1998; Bahia Paraiso – Kennicutt, 1991 and Hyland et al., 1994), much of the background pollution is related to long-term human activities associated with the main bases. Indeed, most investigations of permanently staffed Antarctic bases have detected hydrocarbon contamination in both sediments and marine benthic organisms Lenihan et al., 1990, Kennicutt et al., 1992, Kennicutt et al., 1995, Cripps, 1994, Cripps and Priddle, 1995 and Lenihan and Oliver, 1995. There have been fewer studies on the impacts of human sewage effluent but those that have been carried-out have found evidence of coliform contamination in the water column (Bruni et al., 1997) and measurable impacts on marine benthic communities adjacent to the larger bases Lenihan et al., 1990, Lenihan et al., 1995 and Kennicutt et al., 1995. Studies on rates of organic breakdown have also indicated that the low water temperatures and consequently reduced activities of micro-organisms are likely to lead to greater persistence of human organic waste Howington et al., 1994 and Statham and McMeekin, 1994.</segment><segment>The importance of monitoring the effects of human activities in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic has been formalized in the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (1991). This requires the different national Antarctic research programmes to assess the impact of past and existing activities as well as to establish monitoring for future activities (Walton and Shears, 1994).</segment><segment>The Australian Antarctic Division maintains a total of four permanently staffed bases in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic region. Staffing levels are variable throughout the year with maximum occupancies during the summer and minimum occupancies during winter. At Macquarie Island (54°20′S, 158°58′E), which is located approximately 1500 km south of Tasmania (Fig. 1), the staffing levels vary from 16 in the winter to over 50 during the summer. Numbers may temporarily exceed 50 during resupply trips when staff changeovers occur and round-trippers are housed ashore.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. The location of Macquarie Island in the Southern Ocean.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>The sewage treatment and disposal system at Macquarie Island is simple. Sewage is stored in a header tank, macerated, degreased and discharged into the upper intertidal region in Garden Cove to the east of the base (Fig. 2). The eastern side of the island is more sheltered than the western side which is exposed to the prevailing westerly winds and sea-swells. Nevertheless, wave action is sometimes considerable on the northern shores of the east coast resulting from both refraction of waves around the top of the island and from periodic changes from the dominant pattern of offshore winds to one of strong onshore winds (e.g. Pople et al., 1990). For most of the time, the southern shores of embayments receive greater levels of wave action than the northern shores.</segment><segment>Fig. 2. Map of Macquarie Island showing the location of the sampling sites. Sewage effluent from the ANARE station (S) is pumped to Garden Cove (GC) where it is discharged on the southern shore in the mid-upper tidal region. Bay 1 and Bay 2 are small but distinct embayments to the north of Garden Cove.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>This paper presents the results of an initial investigation into the effects of the outfall at Macquarie Island on the fauna occurring in an intertidal habitat which is closest to the point of discharge and thus consistently receives effluent from the outfall.</segment><segment>This evaluation of the impacts of the sewage outfall at Macquarie Island focused on the macroinvertebrate community associated with the red alga Chaetangium fastigiatum. This algal species has a widespread distribution on the shore of Macquarie Island, occupying the intertidal zone immediately below the Upper Red Zone (dominated by Porphyra columbina – Simpson, 1976 and Ricker, 1987). C. fastigiatum turf was present within 2–3 m of the outfall and throughout the embayments to the east of the ANARE base, providing a uniform habitat in which to assess the impacts of sewage discharge.</segment><segment>Initial inspection of the isthmus area (Fig. 2) indicated that there were three adjacent bays which appeared to have different levels of organic enrichment. Garden Cove is the site of the sewage outfall and at the time of these surveys also supported a small population of elephant seals and small rookeries of Rock-hopper and King Penguins. The small bay immediately to the north (Bay 2 in Fig. 2), supported a dense population of elephant seals and a moderately sized Gentoo Penguin rookery. There was obvious evidence of organic enrichment within this bay both in the form of seal wallows (mud and excrement filled holes in which seals wallow) and large deposits of rotting kelp (Durvillaea antarctica). The third bay (Bay 3 in Fig. 2), which was immediately north of Bay 2, had a very low population of megafauna and no obvious accumulation of decomposing organic material.</segment><segment>Two sites were established within each bay, one on the northern, and one on the southern shore (Fig. 2). This pattern of site allocation was based on the fact that the outfall is located on the southern shore of Garden Cove; the site on the northern shore was thus as far from the outfall as possible within the cove. As there is evidence that community structure of rocky shore biota is affected by gradients of wave exposure at Macquarie Island (Pople et al., 1990; Smith and Simpson, unpub. data), with southern sides of bays being more exposed than northern sides, the same pattern of site allocation was selected for the two additional bays. Although there was a discrepancy in the size of the bays (Fig. 2), sites on the northern and southern aspects were standardized as much as possible in terms of topography and aspect. The site on the southern shore of Garden Cove was established within 3 m of the point of discharge of the outfall. Each site was established at the same level of the shore.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Distribution of Enteric Bacteria in Antarctic Seawater Surrounding the Dumont d’Urville Permanent Station (Adélie Land) </title>
	<fulltext><segment>faecal pollution; coliform; seawater; spatial distribution; seasonal changes; Antarctica</segment><segment>Sewage wastes have been disposed into the ocean for many years. The survival of human enteric bacteria in aquatic environment has attracted an intense interest in view of its public health significance Xu et al., 1982, Monfort and Baleux, 1991, Dupray et al., 1993, Gauthier and Clément, 1994 and Nelson et al., 1996. Following the early exploratory expeditions in Antarctica, the growing human activity has resulted in the accumulation of waste of various types around larger installations (Lenihan et al., 1990). Such observations have stimulated interest in determining the environmental impact of human settlements, in observance of the fundamental principles laid out for the preservation of this pristine environment. In the vicinity of the largest permanent human settlement in Antarctica (McMurdo station) Howington et al. (1992) and Mc Feters et al. (1993) reported that high concentrations of faecal coliform indicators were found along the ca. 1-km shoreline. In much smaller and temporary settlement (summer station of Terra Nova Bay) Bruni et al. (1997) found a persistent marine faecal pollution localized in the narrow zone strictly surrounding the outfall or at the furthest 100 m from the seashore, both in ice-free waters and under the ice. Untreated sewage has been released from Dumont d&apos;Urville permanent station (Adélie land, Antarctica), into Southern Ocean for more than 40 yr. The outfall discharged the sewage directly at the base of a deep shelf cliff at approximately 50-m of the seashore. In wintertime the frozen sewage accumulated between the outfall and the land fast ice.</segment><segment>This study was initiated to determine the occurrence and distribution of faecal bacteria in the seawater surrounding the sewage outfall of the Dumont d’Urville station.</segment><segment>Studies were done from December 1996 to January 1998 in the nearshore environment of Dumont d’Urville station located on Petrel Island, Adelie Land, Antarctica. The ocean adjacent to the settlement characteristically is covered by sea ice (ca. 1–1.5 m thick) during much of the year. Sea ice usually breaks out in summer (December–January) and reforms during the fall (May). The seawater temperature ranged from +0.5°C in summer to −2.1°C in winter. Ice free seawater samples were taken from 25 stations regularly distributed around the sewage outfall of the station in January 1997 and December 1998. Control (pristine) samples were also collected at `Cap Jules&apos; and `Rocher du débarquement&apos; about 30 km, respectively to the north and west of Petrel Island. Samples were collected directly at seawater surface using sterile glass bottles. Bacterial analyses were begun in the `Dumont d’Urville marine biological laboratory&apos; no more than one hour after the sampling.</segment><segment>During winter, weekly sampling in underlying seawater allowed a regular survey of coliform bacteria. After drilling through the ice cover, using a 10-cm (internal diameter) ice-coring auger, subsurface seawater samples were collected in sterile glass bottles.</segment><segment>Three replicates of each of the seawater samples were filtered through membrane filters (0.45 μm, Sartorius) and then placed on Tergitol agar supplemented with TTC as described by Carlucci and Pramer (1960). Plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Typical colonies were counted and the number of bacteria was calculated from the volume of filtered water and expressed as colony forming units (CFU 100 ml−1).</segment><segment>The spatial distribution of coliform bacteria is shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. The highest density of enteric bacteria (850 CFU 100 ml−1 in January 1997 and 1200 CFU 100 ml−1 in December 1998) was recorded in the direct vicinity of the outfall. The differences observed between the two data sets were probably related to the different times elapsed after ice breaking (2 weeks in December 1998 and 4 weeks in January 1997).

	<title>Relationship Between Oil Exposure and Reproductive Parameters in Fish Collected Following the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill </title>
	<fulltext><segment>oil spill; hydrocarbons; reproduction; dolly varden; pollock; yellowfin sole</segment><segment>Exposure to petroleum and its components can potentially damage fishery resources in numerous ways, including reducing the reproductive rates of fish stocks (National Research Council, 1985). Several laboratory studies have documented oil-related declines in reproductive parameters in marine teleosts. The types of effects observed include alterations in levels of reproductive hormones, inhibited gonadal development, and reduced egg and larval viability Idler et al., 1995, Johnson et al., 1995, Thomas and Budiantara, 1995 and Truscott et al., 1992.</segment><segment>Field studies conducted following the Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS) have indicated the oil exposure in a number of marine teleost species Collier et al., 1993, Collier et al., 1996, Hom et al., 1996 and Krahn et al., 1992. Fish collected from oil-impacted areas had high concentrations of metabolites of aromatic compounds in bile, particularly metabolites fluorescing at the same wavelengths as naphthalene (NPH) and phenanthrene (PHN), two major components the Prudhoe Bay crude oil (PBCO) released from the Exxon Valdez (Krahn et al., 1992). In addition, levels of these biliary fluorescent aromatic compounds (FACs) were highly correlated with sediment petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations (Krahn et al., 1992).</segment><segment>Upon finding indications of high levels of oil exposure in both dolly varden (Salvelinus malma) and yellowfin sole (Limanda aspera) following the EVOS in 1989, we initiated an investigation of its potential impact on reproductive function in these two species. Pollock (Theagra chalcogramma) were subsequently included as a target species when, in 1990, fish sampled as far as 640 km away from the Exxon Valdez grounding site showed evidence of oil exposure (Collier et al., 1996). These three species were particularly useful as sentinel animals because they occupy distinct habitats and may be subjected to different degrees of oil exposure; dolly varden reside in the littoral zone, yellowfin sole reside on nearshore bottom sediment, and pollock, a bathypelagic species, feeds within the water column.</segment><segment>The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between oil exposure and reproductive parameters in female dolly varden, yellowfin sole, and pollock sampled following the EVOS. Plasma estradiol-17β (E2), gonadotropin-I (GTH-I, dolly varden only), and gonadosomatic index (GSI), were measured in association with biliary FACs, an index of oil exposure. The reproductive hormone, E2, triggers vitellogenesis in female teleosts, and is an effective indicator of the initiation of gonadal development (Ng and Idler, 1983). GTH-I is the primary pituitary hormone controlling gametogenesis in teleosts (Swanson et al., 1989). Therefore, decreases in these hormones could interfere with gonadal development or disrupt the hormonal signal for final maturation and spawning Casillas et al., 1991, Johnson et al., 1988 and Swanson et al., 1989. GSI provides an anatomical index of gonadal maturation. Relationships between reproductive parameters and biliary FAC metabolites were evaluated. In addition, results were used to estimate the likely reproductive status of the target species in the year immediately following the spill.</segment><segment>Dolly varden were collected in May and June of 1989 and 1990, yellowfin sole in May and June of 1989, 1990 and 1991, and pollock in February and March of 1990 and 1991. The sampling times were chosen to coincide with the peak gonadal recrudescence periods for these species. Dolly varden spawn during the late summer and early fall months (Armstrong, 1970), while yellowfin sole spawn during the late spring and early summer months Nichols, 1993 and Wilderbuer et al., 1992, and pollock spawn during the winter and early spring months Kim, 1989 and Yoon, 1981. Female dolly varden and yellowfin sole were collected in Prince William Sound (PWS), Kenai Peninsula, and Shelikof Strait, while pollock were collected in PWS, Kenai Peninsula, Shelikof Strait, and the Gulf of Alaska (Table 1;Fig. 1). Exposure indices (biliary FACs) for all three species were measured for each sampling year. However, reproductive parameters were not measured in the first year of sampling for any of the fish species.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Infaunal Assemblages on Constructed Intertidal Mudflats at Jonesport, Maine (USA) </title>
	<fulltext><segment>benthos; mudflat; dredged material; habitat construction; community structure; Maine</segment><segment>Dredged materials have been used to construct or restore a variety of coastal habitats, including salt marshes, sea grasses, oyster beds, coastal dunes, and waterbird nesting sites (e.g., Parnell et al., 1986, Yozzo et al., 1996 and Clarke et al., 1999). Coastal habitats have also resulted incidentally from engineering projects, such as the creation of intertidal sandflats during construction of aquaculture facilities in Japan (Hosokawa, 1997). Kirby (1995) has suggested that serious consideration should be given to employing dredged materials in the construction of intertidal mudflats to help protect shorelines and replace lost habitat.</segment><segment>Intertidal mudflats are critical components of coastal ecosystems throughout the world, providing forage for large populations of fish, invertebrates, and birds (e.g., Quammen, 1982, Baird et al., 1985 and Thrush et al., 1994). Extensive mudflats are found along the Atlantic coast of North America Peterson and Peterson, 1979 and Whitlach, 1982. In the state of Maine (USA), intertidal flats account for 27% of all intertidal habitat (Maine State Planning Office, 1983). Infauna associated with these habitats support demersal-feeding fish such as commercially important winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus) (Wells et al., 1973) and ecologically important tomcod (Microgadus tomcod) and Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) Gilmurray and Daborn, 1981 and Salinas, 1980. Migratory shorebirds, including short-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus griseus), semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla), and black-bellied plover (Pluvialis squatarola), rely on intertidal infauna for a major portion of their diet in preparation for their annual migrations Schneider and Harrington, 1981 and Matthews et al., 1992. The amphipod Corophium volutator is particularly important for several of these species Gratto et al., 1984 and Peer et al., 1986. Resident shorebird species such as herring, ring-billed, and black-backed gulls (Larus argentatutus, L. delawarensis, and L. marinus, respectively) feed heavily on the infaunal polychaete Nereis virens (Ambrose, 1986). In addition, the infaunal clam Mya arenaria (soft-clam) and the bait-worms N. virens (clamworm) and Glycera dibranchiata (bloodworm) are fished commercially (e.g., Brown, 1993).</segment><segment>To explore the potential for beneficially using dredged material in the construction of intertidal mudflats, the US Army Corps of Engineers New England District (CENED) deposited 53 500 m3 of muddy dredged materials, resulting from breakwater construction and channel dredging at Jonesport, Maine, along the leeward side of Sheep Island (Fig. 1). Sediments were placed in a shallow, circular basin surrounded by rocky ledges and additional rocky material resulting from breakwater construction placed along the edges of the site to help protect and stabilize the dredged materials. Begun in January 1988 and completed in January 1989, the dredging and construction project resulted in 1.2 ha of muddy intertidal habitat (Fleming et al., 1991). The constructed flat (CF) and a nearby reference area (REF) of intertidal muddy sand were monitored with respect to infaunal community structure and sediment texture in June 1990 (Flemming et al., 1991). Monitoring over the next two years indicated that the constructed mudflat was rapidly colonized by benthos. While species composition became similar to that of the REF within three years, differences in relative abundances persisted Fleming et al., 1991, Ray et al., 1994a and Ray et al., 1994b. During these studies, an additional mudflat resulting incidentally from intertidal disposal of dredged material was identified by local residents at Beals Island (Fig. 1). The Beals Island disposal operation occurred prior to the National Environmental Protection Act of 1969 and US Army Corps of Engineers project files contained no information on the precise location of the disposal area. The area corresponding to resident descriptions was examined and the presence of stiff clays similar to dredged sediments (clay balls) below the sediment surface confirmed the area as a probable disposal site. Initial results of sampling in 1991 and 1992 Ray et al., 1994a and Ray et al., 1994b revealed subtle differences in species and biomass structure between the CF and an adjacent REF. The limited database for the two study areas (maximum of three sets of annual samples) and presence of differences in infaunal assemblage structure between sites suggested that additional sampling over a longer time period was advisable. In the present work, the original data are re-analysed and compared to results from three additional annual sampling efforts conducted over six years. The primary objective of this study is to determine if there are differences in benthic assemblage structure between constructed and natural mudflats.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Map of study area. Study sites indicated as darkened areas. Inset-location of study area in State of Maine (USA).Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>Monitoring for the original project began at Sheep Island in June 1990 with a survey of infauna and sediments conducted by the CENED and Normadeau Associates at both the CF and a nearby REF of intertidal muddy, gravelly sand (Flemming et al., 1991). There are no natural mudflats adjacent to Sheep Island and, although sediment texture of the REF selected for the study differed from that of the CF, it was deemed to be the most reasonable alternative. In all years after 1990, sampling occurred in August or September during low tides and was conducted by the CENED and the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center. Sheep Island was sampled in 1991, 1992, 1994, and 1998. No samples were taken in 1993 due to inclement weather. Beals Island was sampled annually between 1991 and 1994 and again in 1998. As at Sheep Island, there are no natural mudflats in the vicinity and a nearby area of intertidal muddy sand was established as the REF. Differences between the Beals Island sites include a slightly lower elevation (∼10 cm) and moderate density of Zostera marina at the REF, while the CF had more cohesive sediments and only a sparse cover of Z. marina, as well as the aforementioned differences in sediments.</segment><segment>Situated on the leeward side of their respective islands, both study areas (Sheep Island and Beals Island) are protected from erosion by oceanic swells and storm-driven waves. Erosion due to breakup of shorefast ice may be of concern during the spring, however no sediment gouges were noted during the study. Both areas also lie outside the estuarine mixing zones of nearby estuaries (Englishman and Nassaguagus Bays) limiting their exposure to lowered salinity. Although Sheep Island is unpopulated and accessible only by boat, evidence of soft-clam digging in 1994 and 1998 indicates that it is subjected to some anthropogenic disturbance. Digging for soft-clams and bait-worms at Beals Island is sufficiently intense to result in some alteration of infaunal assemblages (e.g., Brown and Wilson, 1997). There are also a number of private residences along the shore of Alley Bay, which may contribute to disturbance of the area.</segment><segment>Infaunal samples were collected with a 7.5 cm diameter coring tube taken to a sediment depth of 10 cm. A maximum of 30 cores were collected at each site on each sampling date, 1990–1993; sample size was reduced to 15 cores in 1994 and 1998. Samples were spaced at least 2 m apart along three transects oriented perpendicular to the shoreline. Samples were rinsed over a 0.5-mm mesh screen, fixed in 4% formalin, and transported to the laboratory where they were transferred to 70% ethanol and stained with rose bengal solution to facilitate sorting of specimens. After staining, the samples were examined under 3x magnification and the specimens separated from the remaining sediment and detritus and stored in 70% ethanol. Specimens were then identified to the lowest practicable taxonomic level and counted. Taxonomic verification of oligochaetes was performed by Dr Robert Diaz, Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences. All other taxonomic verifications were the responsibility of the author. Wet-weight biomass was determined for major taxonomic groups (e.g., Polychaeta, Crustacea).</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Composition, Abundance and Stratification of Macrobenthos in the Marine Area Impacted by Tar Aggregates Derived from the Haven Oil Spill (Ligurian Sea, Italy) </title>
	<fulltext><segment>macrobenthos; tar aggregates; Haven oil spill; Ligurian Sea; north-west Mediterranean</segment><segment>It is well known that oil spills represent one of the major threats to marine environments and may determine severe impacts both on nearshore biota (i.e., intertidal belt) and benthic subtidal habitats Chassé, 1978, NCR (National Research Council), 1985, Dauvin, 1982, Danovaro et al., 1995 and Jewett et al., 1999. The knowledge of the effects deriving from oil impacts chiefly come from two different approaches: (a) laboratory studies mainly focused to assess the toxicity induced by hydrocarbons to individual species; (b) episodic investigations in situ following accidental spills. The first mentioned approach, however, may provide limited information in forecasting the effects of oil spills on the natural marine environment and biological communities (Jewett et al., 1999). The types and amount of oil released, local environmental conditions, the weathering of oil, the peculiar dynamics of each accident and the type of employed clean-up techniques, in fact, may result in a variety of different ecological effects and toxicological impacts Jewett et al., 1999 and Edgar and Barrett, 2000.</segment><segment>As far as the effects of accidental oil spills on subtidal benthic habitats are concerned, petroleum may be driven towards the bottom via diffusion, by settlement of particulates derived from beached oil which is redistributed by water movements, and by sinking of heavier fractions (Jewett et al., 1999). From this point of view, the impact on epifaunal and infaunal soft-bottom communities can be severe, although, in some cases, unpredictable. Accidental oil spills, in fact, may result in enhancing the abundance of some tolerant species via organic enrichment and, in other cases, in a diffuse reduction of the abundance or in the local extinction of more sensitive species due to direct toxicity Spies and DesMarais, 1983 and Peterson et al., 1996. In spite of the equivocal results obtained in some circumstances, marine macrobenthos has been widely used in programmes monitoring pollution effects, including the impact of accidental oil spills Chassé, 1978, Dauvin, 1982, Dauvin, 1998, Smith and Simpson, 1995 and Jewett et al., 1999. In this respect, changes in the taxonomic composition, abundance and biomass of macrobenthic organisms may be used in order to obtain an integrated response to several kinds of man-induced disturbances (Warwick and Clarke, 1994).</segment><segment>In April 1991, the super tanker Haven exploded off Genoa (Ligurian Sea, north-west Mediterranean) when fully laden with about 144 000 t of ‘heavy Iranian crude oil’, whose oil weighing around tens of thousands of tons sank to the bottom. The combustion of the crude oil (lasted about 70 h) was favoured during the attempt to draw the hull at shallow depths with the intention to better manage the consequences of the accidental spill. During this operation, the hull broke in three portions and sank to the bottom ENEA, 1992 and Relini, 1994.</segment><segment>The aim of this study is to test the null hypothesis that there were no differences in the composition, abundance and stratification of soft-bottom macrobenthos between sites contaminated by tar aggregates deriving from the Haven accident that occurred in 1991 and reference control sites.</segment><segment>Following the explosion, the largest of the three portions of the tanker Haven sank in the marine area off Arenzano (Ligurian Sea, north-west Mediterranean, Italy: 44°22′N, 08°42′E; Fig. 1) at a depth of about 75 m. Around this portion of shipwreck, a large amount of tar has accumulated in the form of aggregates of various sizes caused by both the drop of the heavier fractions of combusted oil from surface waters and the spilling from the tanker after sinking. In the investigated area, the bottom type was mainly represented by coarse organogenic sediments enriched with a fine muddy fraction. In the nearby area, a belt of organogenic concretion is also present.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Location of the study area and sampling sites; shipwreck is indicated by the fill circle.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>Three sampling sites (A1, A2, A3) were randomly selected within the potentially impacted area, located around the Haven shipwreck from 75 to 80 m depth, where tar aggregates were observed during previous preliminary surveys. Three control sites (B1, B2, B3) were also randomly selected at comparable depth and at a given distance apart from the shipwreck, where sediments were completely free of tar ( Fig. 1).</segment><segment>To study the benthic macrofauna, four replicated bottom samples at each of the six sites investigated were collected using a box-corer (maximum penetration depth 20 cm) during November 1999. The stratification of the macrobenthos was studied by subdividing the core sediment into three levels: 0–5 cm (superficial layer), 5–10 cm (intermediate layer), &gt;10 cm (deep layer). Bottom samples were rinsed free of sediment, sieved through a 1 mm mesh size and fixed in 4% neutralized formaldehyde.</segment><segment>To provide a gross estimate of the amount of tar into each sample, a semi-quantitative scale point was used, as follows:</segment><segment>0=absence of tar aggregates;1=aggregates &lt;1 cm (maximum diameter);2=aggregates from 1 to 2 cm;3=aggregates from 2 to 5 cm;4=aggregates &gt;5 cm;5=large amount of tar plus aggregates of various sizes.</segment><segment>The polychaetes/amphipods ratio was calculated in order to provide evidence of differences in direct toxicity at the contaminated and control sites.</segment><segment>Abundance data were analysed by Analysis of Variance (Three Way ANOVA; performed using the GMAV5 package from University of Sidney). Factors ‘impact’ (impacted vs non-impacted area) and ‘layer’ (0–5, 5–10, &gt;10 cm) were treated as fixed factors, while ‘site’ was considered as a random factor nested in ‘impact’. To meet the assumptions of statistical parametric procedures, data were preventively tested by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for normality and Cochran’s C test for homogeneity of variances in order to operate appropriate transformations, whenever necessary. In some cases, however, transformations did not produce homogeneous variances, but ANOVA was used anyway because it is fairly robust to departures of variance from homogeneity when sample sizes are equal. In these cases, however, a setting of α=0.01 was used to compensate for the increased likelihood of Type I error. SNK test was used for multiple comparisons a posteriori (Underwood, 1997).</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Development and Validation of Biocriteria Using Benthic Macroinvertebrates for North Carolina Estuarine Waters </title>
	<fulltext><segment>In the development of meaningful measures of aquatic health, first efforts were usually chemically based and parameter specific (e.g. dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity) (Karr, 1991). Next were attempts to find a single reductionist metric (e.g. evenness or H′) or graph (e.g. abundance biomass curves) to describe abundance and diversity of organisms within an ecosystem Washington, 1984 and Warwick, 1986. Following that, came statistical treatments of data collected in nearfield/farfield situations (Ellis and Hoover, 1990, Gray et al., 1990 and Harrel and Hall, 1991). The most powerful of these methods, involving multivariate methods (e.g. PCA, MDS) have proven to be more sensitive to detecting pollution than univariate methods, but results are difficult for non-scientists to interpret Warwick and Clarke, 1991, Papathanassiou and Zenetos, 1993 and Wilson and Jeffrey, 1994. More recently, biocriteria based on a predefined reference condition were developed, and severity of impacts was judged by the deviation from this condition Karr et al., 1986, Lenat, 1988 and Weisberg et al., 1997. Often these criteria include some measurement of pollution tolerance.</segment><segment>Estuarine systems, being chemically and physically more dynamic and complex, have lagged approximately a decade behind freshwater flowing systems in development of such biocriteria Engle and Summers, 1999, Engle et al., 1994, Karr et al., 1986, Lenat, 1988, Plafkin et al., 1989 and Weisberg et al., 1997. The few successful attempts at biocriteria development in estuaries have utilized heavy coring devices (&gt;40 kg) and moderate to large boats (&gt;8 m) to collect samples of benthic infauna. This biocriteria have not been able to do more than separate degraded areas from reference sites.</segment><segment>From 1993–1995 the State of North Carolina (DWQ) developed an estuarine sampling method using a D-frame net. Three metrics, a new `Hilsenhoff-like&apos; biotic index (EBI), total taxa richness (TT), and amphipod and caridean shrimp taxa richness (A&amp;C), were used to develop biocriteria sensitive enough to differentiate five levels of impact on the benthic fauna. This process is described in detail in Eaton et al. (2000) and summarized in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. The objective of this work was to validate methods, metrics and biocriteria (Weisberg et al., 1992). This validation included: (1) a comparison against referent study results; (2) comparisons of repeated samples at locations over various time scales to look at the effects of seasonal and inter-annual variability on the metrics’ effectiveness; (3) comparing samples from different locations within an area of known water quality to evaluate the effects of varying salinity regimes, current patterns, and bottom types on the metrics.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Summary of method to assign bioclassifications to sweep samples collected in mesohaline and polyhaline waters in North Carolina.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>Fig. 2. Map of sampling sites in North Carolina.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>Shallow (&lt;1.5 m) estuarine waters are sampled using a D-frame dip net with a 600–700 μm mesh bag. All available subtidal benthic habitats are swept continuously for 10 min. Field elutriation of the sample is often required to reduce sample volume. The sample is preserved in 10% formalin with rose bengal. Macroinvertebrates are separated from sediments at the laboratory by visual examination. Macroinvertebrates are identified to the lowest practical taxonomic level, usually species. Abundance is recorded semi-quantitatively as 1–2 rare, 3–9 common, 10–29 abundant, 30–99 very abundant and 100+ dominant. Not more than 100 individuals of any taxon are counted.</segment><segment>An EBI is calculated from the individual taxa&apos;s sensitivity values (ranging from 1 to 5) and weighted for abundance using a formula commonly used in calculating freshwater biotic indices Chutter, 1972, Hilsenhoff, 1977 and Lenat, 1993: &lt;1 K)&quot; title=&quot;Full-size image (&lt;1 K)&quot; src=&quot;/sd/grey_pxl.gif&quot; data-inlimgeid=&quot;1-s2.0-S0025326X00000862-si1.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;1 K)&quot; title=&quot;Full-size image (&lt;1 K)&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0025326X00000862-si1.gif&quot;&gt; where SVi is the sensitivity value of the ith taxa as listed in Appendix A, Ni the semi-quantitative abundance of the ith taxa (recorded as 1, 3, 10, 30 or 100), and Total N is the semi-quantitative sum of individuals in the sample. Reference sites are expected to have a high EBI, A&amp;C and TT. Impacted sites would have a low EBI, with low A&amp;C and TT. A water quality bioclassification of severe (SeI), elevated (EI), moderate (MI), slight (SlI) or no (NI) impact is assigned based on values of these three metrics.</segment><segment>To test the predictive capacity of the DWQ biocriteria by sampling areas of known good, bad, and intermediate water quality, 20 DWQ sweep samples were compared with 20 environmental monitoring and assessment program (EMAP) sites located within 2 km and with comparable substrate. For an explanation of EMAP sites and methodology see Hackney et al., 1998, Hyland et al., 1996 and Hyland et al., 1998. EMAP considered reference (R) sites to be those at or near reference conditions for an area (i.e. unimpacted). All other sites were considered degraded (D). Of the 20 sites compared in this study, three sites were classified as D based on levels of sedimentary pollutants or low dissolved oxygen, while 17 sites were classified as R. For purposes of this comparison, DWQ sites rated NI or SlI were considered equivalent to the EMAP R designation. Sites rated SeI, EI, or MI by DWQ were deemed equivalent to the EMAP D designation. See Fig. 2 for site locations.</segment><segment>In addition, four DWQ sweep samples were collected from stations based on a study delineating areas of varying metal concentrations, including copper at Oriental, NC (Riggs et al., 1990). The copper concentration map indicated Station 1 had 5–9 background, station 2 had 3–4 times background, and stations 3 and 4 had 0–2 times background. Station 3 was collected in clean sand with detritus and SAV (Ruppia maritima), while station 4 was collected from muddy sand with detritus and Spartina to look for habitat related variability. A priori predictions were station 1 would be rated SeI, station 2 would be rated MI and stations 3 and 4 would be rated NI, although slight impacts might be expected at stations 3 and 4 due to development in the area. Mesohaline criteria were used, since salinities in this area historically average 11 ppt (NCDENR, 1998). On the day of sampling, however, salinity was 4–5 ppt.</segment></fulltext>

	<fulltext><segment>heavy metals; baseline values; contaminants; arsenic; mercury</segment><segment>The Kara and Barents Seas have been the subject of increased environmental monitoring efforts in recent years. This is the result of the 1991 disclosure (Yablokov et al., 1993) about the extent of the former Soviet Union&apos;s nuclear weapons testing on the Novaya Zemlya archipelago and dumped military waste offshore of the archipelago (Fig. 1).</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Watersheds of the Kara Sea and locations of selected industrial (including atomic) complexes and the middle Ob Hg latitudinal belt (compiled from Pavlov and Pfirman, 1995; Naidu et al., 1975).Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>Radioactive and other military wastes were dumped in the waters of the Russian Arctic beginning in the late 1950s (Sagers, 1991). In 1964, the bays and inlets off the east coast of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago as well as the Novaya Zemlya Trough became primary dump sites (Yablokov et al., 1993). Champ et al. (1998) present a map (from Dr. Gennady G. Matishov) with locations of military waste disposed of offshore of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, including the trough. In 1991, the eight countries that border the Arctic Ocean established the Arctic monitoring and assessment program (AMAP). The program investigates the content and distribution of contaminants in the Arctic region and their possible origins. This focus was prompted by the possibility that toxic materials could be mobilized to populated coastal areas and important fisheries (Ringold, 1994). During the 1990s studies were done on radionuclides, organic compounds and potentially toxic metals. In some cases, these metals have been found in higher concentrations than natural `baseline&apos; levels in the water column, in surface sediments, and in various regional biota including seagulls, polar bears, and reindeer (Gurvich et al., 1995, Loring et al., 1995, Loring et al., 1997 and Coquery et al., 1995; Loring, pers. comm., 1995; Lee et al., 1995, Lee et al., 1996, Fuhrmann and Dyer, 1996, Siegel et al., 1996, Savinova et al., 1997 and Dietz et al., 1997).</segment><segment>The present research evaluates the concentration and distribution of 18 metals/metalloids, including some that are potentially toxic, in eight cores collected along 650 km in the Novaya Zemlya Trough (Fig. 2) during 1965 (Andrew and Kravitz, 1974). The study of this unique suite of cores is important to the AMAP for three reasons. Firstly, the cores&apos; surface sediments define the concentration of chemical elements present before 1965. This provides researchers a time-concentration marker. Secondly, lower sections of cores are pre-industrial deposits and hence represent natural baseline concentrations. Thirdly, elevated metal concentrations in the upper sections of cores compared to natural concentrations could represent diagenetically enhanced contents and/or anthropogenic additions. These data can be used by AMAP researchers studying cores collected during the 1990s to monitor time-series concentration levels in sediment deposited during the past ∼35 years. Such data in conjunction with those collected from other circum-arctic marine depositional sites can help AMAP scientists continually update baseline values to better assess environmental risks for the regional ecosystem and human populations.</segment><segment>Fig. 2. Core locations in the east Novaya Zemlya Trough.

These include adsorptive effects influenced by texture and mineralogy (Robertson, 1977) and post-depositional physical, biological, and chemical processes. A hypothesis on sources and pathways requires knowledge of the hydrography of the southern Kara Sea and locations of facilities that can generate effluents and emissions with potentially toxic metals.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Volatile Organic Compounds in Various Marine Organisms From the Southern North Sea </title>
	<fulltext><segment>VOCs; marine organisms; southern North Sea; hazard assessment; levels; partitioning; statistical analysis</segment><segment>The potential threat of large-production chemicals to the marine environment has caused considerable concern since the deleterious effects of some of these, such as p,p′-DDT, the drins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), became evident. Much research has since been dedicated to the study of transport mechanisms, environmental distribution, prediction and measurement of fluxes, and adverse environmental effects of important classes of pollutants such as PCBs, aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals Baker and Eisenreich, 1990, Clark et al., 1990, Södergren et al., 1990, Mackay and Paterson, 1991 and Walker and Livingstone, 1992. Much less is known, however, about the fate of other volatile chemicals, even though volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are well-known atmospheric contaminants that are frequently determined in air, drinking water, fresh water, effluents and soils Sweet and Vermette, 1992, Bellar et al., 1974, Anderson et al., 1991 and Jungclaus et al., 1978. Most representatives of the group are important industrial compounds with a high annual production. The annual production of tetrachloromethane, for instance, is estimated at about 300 000 t (Howard, 1990). In Belgium, the emissions of the chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs) chloroform, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, tri- and tretrachloroethylene, exceed those of e.g. lead, lindane, and atrazine. Annual production, together with log Kow data, toxicity and persistence, was one of the main criteria used by the Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution (GESAMP) (GESAMP, 1990) to select potentially harmful substances for the marine environment. The resulting list contained, amongst others, chloroform, tetrachloromethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene. The same compounds are also found on the high-priority compounds list of the Ministerial Declarations of the International Conferences of the North Sea Ministerial Declaration of the Third International Conference on the Protection of the North Sea, 1990 and Ministerial Declaration of the Fourth International Conference on the Protection of the North Sea, 1995 and are recognized as compounds that present an environmental problem by the Norwegian Pollution control authority (Dons and Beck, 1994). For other important VOCs, such as the monoaromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and the xylenes, the need to investigate their presence in the marine environment has been formulated in the Ministerial Declarations of the International Conferences of the North Sea Ministerial Declaration of the Third International Conference on the Protection of the North Sea, 1990 and Ministerial Declaration of the Fourth International Conference on the Protection of the North Sea, 1995.</segment><segment>Despite the potential hazards posed by VOCs, relatively little is known about the abundance or presence of these compounds in the marine environment, especially in biota, and their behaviour in the marine ecosystem. In addition, there are no on-going monitoring programmes for VOCs, in contrast to other organic pollutants such as PCBs (Oslo and Paris Commissions, 1990). Levels reported in the literature are therefore mostly the result of once-only surveys. Pearson and McConnell (1975) were among the first to report concentrations of trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethane, tetrachloromethane and chloroform in various marine organisms from sampling locations along the British coast. The results showed that chlorinated VOCs were present at all trophic levels. The concentrations ranged from 0.02 to 180 ng/g wet weight. Since that time, similar concentrations have been reported for different organisms from various marine locations Pearson and McConnell, 1975, Dickson and Riley, 1976, Ferrario et al., 1985, Yasuhara and Morita, 1987 and Gotoh et al., 1992. An overview of the reported concentrations for the different trophic levels is given in Table 1. Recent findings agree with these earlier observations (Roose and Brinkman, 1998). Generally speaking, the concentrations are of the same order of magnitude as those of other important organic contaminants such as individual PCBs, chlordanes and individual PAHs (North Sea Task Force, 1993).</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Gladstone, Australia Field Studies: Weathering and Degradation of Hydrocarbons in Oiled Mangrove and Salt Marsh Sediments With and Without the Application of an Experimental Bioremediation Protocol </title>
	<fulltext><segment>bioremediation; oil spills; mangroves; salt marshes; hydrocarbon weathering</segment><segment>Oil spills are known to cause severe and long-term damage to mangrove and salt marsh ecosystems (e.g., Burns and Teal, 1979, Wardrop, 1987, Corredor et al., 1990, Teal et al., 1992, Burns et al., 1993, Vandermeulen and Singh, 1994, Duke et al., 1997 and Mille et al., 1998 and others). Mangroves and salt marshes are important in coastal estuaries and bays on all sides of the Australian continent. As shipping terminals, industries and municipalities are also concentrated in the estuaries, these important nursery habitats for many commercially important species of fish and prawns are particularly vulnerable to oil spills (Volkman et al., 1994). Oil spill response scenarios are designed to prevent, when possible, spilled oil from entering these ecologically sensitive habitats Gundlach and Hayes, 1978 and NRC, 1985. When mangrove trees die, the very structure and cohesion of the mangrove habitat becomes unstable Nadeau and Berquist, 1977, Duke and Pinzon, 1993 and Garrity et al., 1994. Similarly, the death of heavily oiled salt marsh and sea grasses causes sediment erosion. The chain reaction of habitat loss and biological effects of the Panama oil spill were documented in detail Jackson et al., 1989 and Keller and Jackson, 1993. As quoted from the executive summary of the Panama report: `Dead trees rotted and fell, logs and storms battered the shore, sea grass rhizome mats entirely disappeared, and sediments from all these environments eroded at rates up to several centimeters per year. The eroded sediments, and unknown amounts of oil in various stages of degradation, were deposited in neighboring habitats including sea grass beds and coral reefs, which had not been contaminated in the original spill.&apos; In many instances, the residence times of oil in these deep mud habitats have stretched to decades, which prolonged ecosystem recovery. Thus, methods to reduce the impact of oil spills on mangroves and salt marshes are of strategic importance to spill response efforts. The aim of this study was to trial a bioremediation strategy for treating two types of oil commonly transported along the Australian coast if stranded in mangrove and salt marsh habitats.</segment><segment>Bioremediation technologies developed for soils and coastal beaches include tilling, nutrient and microbial additions; reviewed by Prince (1993), Atlas (1995), and Swannell et al. (1996). Tilling is unsuitable for mangroves because the preservation of the dense complex root systems is crucial to the survival of the trees. Oil biodegrading micro-organisms have been isolated from marine wetland environments worldwide, therefore it is unlikely that the absence of oil-degrading microbes would limit biodegradation in these areas (e.g., Scherrer, 1988, McKee and Mendolssohn, 1994 and Lee et al., 1995). Review of the literature Holtom et al., 1996 and Swannell et al., 1994 and previous field evaluations (e.g., Scherrer and Mille, 1989, Oudot and Dutrieux, 1989 and Swannell et al., 1995) highlighted several potentially limiting factors to oil biodegradation in mangrove mud. One major factor was anoxia. Preliminary laboratory-based flask experiments demonstrated that oil-degrading micro-organisms were present in all three common types of tropical Australia’s coastal wetlands (Rhizophora and Avicennia mangrove and Halosarcia salt marsh sediments). These experiments also confirmed that oxygen was required to promote a significant rate of biodegradation of petroleum oils (Burns et al., 1999a).</segment><segment>Field trials showed that forced aeration could increase the layer of oxygenated surface mud in a mangrove swamp (Duke et al., 1999). Based on our literature review and our experimental trials, we developed a bioremediation strategy for oil spills in mangrove sediments that included a practical method for aeration of contaminated sediments. This was not intended as a strategy to be used over large areas. Some concern has been expressed about potential damage resulting from forced aeration, which may lead to changes in critical redox potential (McKee and Mendolssohn, 1994). The sub-surface respiration of the roots of mangrove trees and the actions of burrowing animals are effective mechanisms for providing oxygen naturally to anoxic wet land sediment. Thus the plan for the field remediation study was based on selective aeration as a means to promote the survival of the mangrove trees. Trees are vital to maintaining the structural integrity of the forest and provide the necessary habitat for the return of burrowing animals to impacted sediments. Aeration was not tested in the salt marsh experiments because the soil was not anoxic. Nutrient additions were applied to both mangrove and salt marsh plots. Details of the field sites, bioremediation treatments and the biological studies are given in the companion paper in this issue (Duke et al., 2000). The microbiological studies are presented in Ramsay et al. (2000). This paper focuses on sediment chemistry.</segment><segment>The objectives of the chemistry studies were to determine if the bioremediation strategies reduced the persistence of the spilled oils over time or the rate of biodegradation. The study was designed to mimic a catastrophic oil spill approaching the mangroves and salt marshes from seaward. Two different oils were tested. Gippsland oil is a medium range crude from the Bass Strait Basin in southern Australia. Bunker C oil is commonly used in coastal shipping. The study site was several hundred hectares of Rhizophora stylosa forest and contiguous Halosarcia sp. salt marsh habitat that were designated for destruction in an extension area of the Port of Gladstone in southeastern Queensland.</segment><segment>This research was solicited and sponsored by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, who defined the scope of the project and the oils to be tested.</segment><segment>All necessary permits from the regulatory and conservation agencies were obtained in order to conduct these field studies. The plan used a replicated design to facilitate statistically valid interpretation of the chemical data and biological data. Experimental plots were constructed in three mangrove areas of R. stylosa forest in the mid-intertidal zone and four areas of the high-intertidal zone salt marsh above the mangroves. Moore and McLaughlin (1978) demonstrated the need for careful experimental design in field studies. The design was to add enough oil that the surface sediments would reach an oil content of approximately 10% of the sediment dry weight. These were the initial oil concentrations in mangrove mud after the catastrophic Bahia las Minas oil spill in Panama (Burns et al., 1994). The mangrove study sites were in mature stands of 4–6 m tall R. stylosa. The prop roots of the trees on the edges of 6 m2 plots were cut in a path 0.5 m wide to install experimental enclosures. Plastic retaining walls were dug down into the mud to a depth of 20 cm and supported to a height of 1 m. A floating gate was installed that allowed tidal waters to move in and out but retained any floating oil. A litter trap was suspended in the trees. Three sets of plots were established, each with an uncut control plot delineated with marking tape stretched between the trees, a cut un-oiled control plot, an oil plot and a bioremediated oil plot. Salt marsh plots had low-lying vegetation, 5–20 cm tall situated on and within the otherwise bare salt pans behind the mangroves. The salt marsh experiment was conducted with replicates of four (1.2 m diameter or 1.13 m2) plots for each treatment. A site location map and a detail of the mangrove plot positions are shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1. The study site was at 23°50′S and 151°13′E.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Composition, Distribution and Sources of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Sediments of the Gulf of Trieste, Northern Adriatic Sea </title>
	<fulltext><segment>polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; marine sediment; distribution; sources; pollution; northern Adriatic Sea</segment><segment>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are widespread contaminants throughout the environment Blumer, 1976, Suess, 1976 and Harvey, 1996. PAH arise from the incomplete combustion of organic matter in flames, engines and industrial processes and from emissions of noncombustion-derived petrogenic Hites et al., 1977 and Wakeham et al., 1980. Natural sources of PAH include forest-fires, natural petroleum seeps and post-depositional transformation of biogenic precursors (Young and Cerniglia, 1995). The environmental concern about PAH is due to their potential to form highly carcinogenic and mutagenic derivatives such as diols and epoxides Baird, 1995 and Stegeman and Lech, 1991. Once formed, PAH are known to enter the near-shore marine environment through the spillage of petroleum, industrial discharges, atmospheric fallout and urban run-off Neff, 1979, Gevao et al., 1998 and Sharma et al., 1997. Because of their low water solubility, (10−7–10−10 mol m−3), and their hydrophobicity, PAH in the aquatic environment rapidly become associated with inorganic and organic suspended particles Gearing et al., 1980 and Chiou et al., 1998 and subsequent deposition in sediments. The favourable partition coefficients and greater persistence of sedimentary PAH compared to PAHs in solution, means that, in general, sediments contain a PAH concentration which is a factor of 1000 or more higher than in the overlying water column. Therefore, sediments can be used to monitor PAH inputs to the aquatic environment. The importance of sediments as reservoirs for PAH is well documented Nes and Oug, 1997, Prahl et al., 1984 and Maher and Aislabie, 1992.</segment><segment>The distribution of PAH in waters and sediments of the Mediterranean Sea has been the subject of several studies Tolosa et al., 1996, Lipiatou and Albaiges, 1994, Dachs et al., 1997 and Lipiatou et al., 1997, but relatively few of these have focused on the PAH distribution in water and sediments of the Adriatic Sea Marcomini et al., 1986, Dujmov and Sucevic, 1989 and Guzzella and de Paolis, 1994. The waters of the Gulf of Trieste in the northern Adriatic are extensively utilized for tourist and mariculture purposes as well as industrial, and agricultural activities in the hinterland. In consequence extensive areas of the marine environment of the Gulf are potentially affected by organic pollution. Also, freshwater inflow of the tributary rivers, like the Isonzo in the northern part of the Gulf, draining industrial and agricultural areas are a potential source of contamination. A detailed study was, therefore, conducted to investigate the composition, distribution, and the sources of PAH pollution in the Gulf of Trieste. From 17 sampling locations throughout the Gulf of Trieste, sediments were taken and analysed for parent and alkylated PAH. In addition, the history of accumulation of PAH in recent Gulf sediments was determined by collecting a deeper core in the northern part of the Gulf of Trieste.</segment><segment>The sediment sampling sites are shown in Fig. 1, while their exact position was recorded using the global positioning system. The work described herein involves a sampling program undertaken in the winter of 1996. Surficial sediment samples (0–2 cm) were collected using a 40 mm diameter gravity core sampler (Meischner and Rumohr, 1974). In addition, one 3 m core was collected at station GT2.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Locations of 17 sampling stations in the Gulf of Trieste, northern Adriatic Sea, with clusters produced by cluster analysis of PAH concentrations.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>Sediment samples were placed in glass pans (previously washed with methanol and heated at 400°C for 3 h), covered with aluminium foil and allowed to dry at room temperature for 5–6 days. The samples were then homogenized and sieved in a stainless steel sieve (particles 0.05–0.02 mm). After sieving, the samples were transferred into pre-cleaned glass bottles, wrapped with aluminium foil, and refrigerated (−25°C) prior to analysis.</segment><segment>A combination of accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) was used in order to quantitatively extract the PAH from the marine sediments (Notar and Leskovšek, 2000). Approximately 5 g of sample was mixed with 2 g of activated copper powder necessary to decrease the amount of sulphur forming unsoluble copper sulphide and loaded into a 10 ml extraction cartridge. The residual volume was made using wetsupport (diatomaceous earth) addition (2 g). An internal standard mixture containing four deuterated PAH (acenaphthene-d10, chrysene-d12, phenanthrene-d10, perylene-d12) was added directly to the sample prior to the extraction (50 μl of mixture; concentration of each compound 200 μg ml−1). Extraction of PAH was performed in two steps starting with ASE. The sealed extraction cartridge was then placed in a heated (120°C) extraction cell. Extraction started by filling and pressurizing (&lt;1 K)&quot; title=&quot;Full-size image (&lt;1 K)&quot; src=&quot;/sd/grey_pxl.gif&quot; data-inlimgeid=&quot;1-s2.0-S0025326X00000928-si1.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;1 K)&quot; title=&quot;Full-size image (&lt;1 K)&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0025326X00000928-si1.gif&quot;&gt;, 2000 psi ) the cell with methylene chloride. The extraction outlet valve was closed allowing 10 min static extraction. Following static extraction, the extraction outlet valve is then opened to perform a dynamic extraction with methylene chloride at a flow rate of 5–6 ml min−1. The extract was then passed through the stainless steel outlet tube and trapped in the collection vial. The outlet tube was ice-cooled (0°C) to prevent the loss of highly volatile 2-3-ring PAH. When 60 ml of methylene chloride had passed through the extraction cartridge, the solvent supply pump valve was closed, and the carbon dioxide supply pump valve opened pressurizing the cell to &lt;1 K)&quot; title=&quot;Full-size image (&lt;1 K)&quot; src=&quot;/sd/grey_pxl.gif&quot; data-inlimgeid=&quot;1-s2.0-S0025326X00000928-si2.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;1 K)&quot; title=&quot;Full-size image (&lt;1 K)&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0025326X00000928-si2.gif&quot;&gt; (120°C), starting the dynamic step of supercritical fluid extraction. The consumption of supercritical carbon dioxide was 20 ml at a flow rate of 2–3 ml min−1, and was trapped in the 60 ml of methylene chloride extract originating from the first (ASE) extraction step. The whole extraction time was 30 min. Cooling of the outlet tube during this step is not necessary, because of the carbon dioxide expansion effect occurring along the outlet tube. All extracts were dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate and reduced in volume to 1 ml under a gentle stream of nitrogen at room temperature. Extracts were analysed without further purification of the sample.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Evidence for Systemic Changes in the Benthic Fauna of Tropical Estuaries as a Result of Urbanization </title>
	<fulltext><segment>heavy metals; macrobenthos; petroleum hydrocarbons; scales of variation; urban pollution</segment><segment>The growth of metropolitan centres around coastal waterways has caused significant changes in the quality of marine habitats for plants and animals. Estuarine environments, in particular, have been extensively modified, as vegetation in the catchments has been replaced with impermeable surfaces, shorelines have been reclaimed and hardened, and natural patterns of water-flow altered by dredging and coastal construction. These physical changes are usually compounded by chronic declines in water quality as a result of the direct discharge of waste from adjacent industrial and municipal sources, urban run-off and aerial deposition of contaminants (Kennish, 1992). Large concentrations of heavy metals, organochlorines and hydrocarbons, some of which are highly toxic to marine fauna, are sequestered in the sediments of urban estuaries and can have long-lasting effects on the fauna (Lake et al., 1979, Hoffman et al., 1984, Barrick and Prahl, 1987, Latimer et al., 1990, Daskalakis and O&apos;Connor, 1995, Sanders, 1995 and Kucklick et al., 1997).</segment><segment>Although there is now a considerable body of work on the ecological effects of a variety of these disturbances (e.g. Long et al., 1995), the combined impacts of urban development on the fauna of estuaries have proven difficult to quantify Luoma, 1996 and Vernberg, 1997. Anthropogenic impacts are usually superimposed on highly heterogeneous patterns in the distribution and abundance of fauna that are related to naturally variable physical and chemical gradients within the estuaries (Chester et al., 1983, Livingston, 1987, Aschan, 1990, Desroisiers et al., 1990, Ferraro et al., 1991, Morrisey et al., 1992, Engle et al., 1994 and Rakocinski et al., 1997). For example, in a recent survey of 319 estuarine sites throughout the northern Gulf of New Mexico, variation in the structure of macrobenthic assemblages was mostly explained by gradients in salinity, water depth, and the silt/clay content of the sediment, and not by contaminant distributions. Distributions of heavy metals and other pollutants explained only residual variation in the fauna, with greatest concentrations occurring mostly at low-salinity, deep or muddy sites (Rakocinski et al., 1997).</segment><segment>Rapid accumulation of pollutants in the sediments and low-levels of sediment exchange also mean that the distribution of contaminants within urbanized estuaries is spatially heterogeneous, with `hot spots&apos; of accumulation occurring around major sources of pollutants or in depositional environments, where fine sediment particles and organic matter accumulate Morrisey et al., 1994 and Kucklick et al., 1997. Because of this heterogeneity, two general patterns of change in the benthic fauna might be expected with increasing urbanization. If contaminants are patchily distributed throughout the estuary (as is most commonly the case), chronic changes in the fauna will be characterized by an increase in the spatial variability of assemblages in the same general habitat type, as the fauna at degraded sites diverges from that in other, less contaminated sites (Caswell and Cohen, 1991 and Warwick and Clarke, 1993). Where the number and size of degraded patches is small, this variability may be dampened by immigration and recruitment from elsewhere in the estuary, thereby obscuring impacts on local assemblages (Luoma, 1996). If, however, a large proportion of the available habitat is degraded, changes in the fauna are likely to be more widespread and will be detected as a general decline in variability among similar patches throughout the entire estuary. These two scenarios represent different conceptual stages in the decline of overall estuarine `health&apos;, as impacts progress from being relatively localized to more systemic. Each can be detected only through the use of sampling designs that incorporate a range of spatial scales (Morrisey et al., 1992). For example, to estimate the variance among habitat patches within an estuary, it is necessary to sample multiple examples of the same habitat-type. Changes in the variance can then only be detected by comparison to a time series of similar such surveys or by reference to assemblages in other estuaries that have not been affected by urban development.</segment><segment>Here, we test this general model of estuarine decline by comparing variation in the benthic faunal assemblages of two urban and three non-urban estuaries in North Queensland, Australia. The paper uses a range of univariate and multivariate statistics to describe variability in the fauna at several spatial scales of sampling: among urbanized and non-urban estuaries, among multiple estuaries of each catchment-type and among multiple sites within each estuary. We explore relationships between patterns in the distribution of the fauna and variation in the distribution of heavy metal and hydrocarbon contaminants in the sediment.</segment><segment>A hierarchical sampling design was used to describe patterns of variation in the benthos of two urban estuaries – Ross Creek and Ross River (19°14′S, 146°50′E) – and three non-urban estuaries – Barramundi Creek (19°15′S, 146°51′E), Barratta Creek (19°27′S, 147°15′E) and Cromarty Creek – in the dry-tropics of north Queensland, Australia (Fig. 1). We sampled surface sediments at three separate sites in the marine-dominated reaches of each estuary. Sample sites were chosen haphazardly in similar habitat types that were generally depositional environments, between 3 and 4 m deep (Australian Height Datum) with similar sediment characteristics. Sampling sites within each estuary were each at least 1 km apart.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Proximity of the two urban (Ross Creek and Ross River) and three rural estuaries (Cromarty Creek, Barratta Creek and Barramundi Creek) to the city of Townsville.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>All sampling was done in December 1996. This region is characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons. Between December and March the average rainfall is between 800 and 1200 mm and daytime temperatures range between 28°C and 32°C. In the dry season (April–November), the average rainfall is 300 mm and temperatures are between 22°C and 26°C. In 1996, on-set of the wet season was delayed and the region had been subject to an extended drought. Conditions prevalent at the time of sampling, therefore, were characteristic of periods of low freshwater input into the catchments.</segment><segment>Catchments of the two urban estuaries – Ross Creek and Ross River (19°14′S, 146°50′E) – are located within the city of Townsville, the largest metropolitan centre in tropical Australia (population ∼140 000). Ross Creek is a former tributary of Ross River that has been substantially modified by urban development. For most of its length, the natural intertidal habitats have been replaced by revetment walls and breakwaters. Its immediate catchment contains a mixture of light and heavy industry and the commercial centre of the city. The Port of Townsville, which services the northern mining and sugar industries, is situated at the entrance to Ross Creek and handles large quantities of copper, lead, zinc and nickel concentrates. Previous studies have recorded elevated concentrations of a range of trace metals within the sediments of Ross Creek, that are most likely associated with urban run-off and industrial activity adjacent to the Creek (Reichelt and Jones, 1994).</segment></fulltext>

Although concentrations of enteric microorganisms in seas are often reduced as result of dilution related to the design of the outfall system, and the environmental factors, salinity and sunlight, some pathogens survive long enough in sufficiently high concentrations to cause infection and disease in bathers and to contaminate shellfish Vasl et al., 1980, Bravo and de Vincente, 1992 and Davies-Colley et al., 1994. The most common pathogens include strains of Salmonella, Vibrio, and human enteric viruses. Aeromonas species (Seidler et al., 1980) and Clostridium perfringens (Matches et al., 1974) are also associated with waterborne diseases.</segment><segment>Rittenberg et al. (1958) found that coliforms were extended for considerable distances around two outfalls discharging unchlorinated primary effluent, and over a less extensive area around an outfall discharging more thoroughly treated sewage. Goyal et al. (1977) monitored residential coastal canals in Texas, and found that bottom sediments were reservoirs of enteric bacteria, which may be resuspended. Spores of C. perfringens survive longer than the coliforms. High numbers of C.perfringens were detected in marine sediments near the sewage outfall at Seattle&apos;s West Point (Matches et al., 1974) and off New Jersey, areas with high C. perfringens levels were associated with known sewage sludge dumping (Hill et al., 1993).</segment><segment>This study was carried out to: (1) determine the presence and vertical distribution of selected microorganisms in shelf sediments collected from several depths of water and several distances from White’s Point outfall, Palos Verdes, California, (2) determine if sewage solids in marine sediments represent a reservoir of enteric pathogens and (3) determine if concentrations of standard indicator bacteria were related to the relative amounts of sewage solids present in the sediments. It was conducted in conjunction with a comprehensive sampling and testing program by the County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County (CSDLAC) to assess effects of improved industrial waste source control and of increased treatment at the Joint Water Pollution Control Plant (JWPCP) as well as to provide a baseline for future evaluations.</segment><segment>The JWPCP discharged wastewaters, and a sidestream from dewatering stabilized sludge, into the Pacific Ocean at White&apos;s Point off Palos Verdes since 1934 Moshiri et al., 1982 and Wunderlich et al., 1985. A staged reduction of sewage solids discharge began in the 1970s (Moshiri et al., 1982), to be completed with full secondary treatment in 2002. Ocean bottom sediment samples were collected from four different locations in the area of the outfall (Fig. 1). Samples, were taken at water depths of 30.5, 61 and 305 m (Table 1), selected to represent sites with high, moderate and low impact from sewage particulates, based on trace contaminant concentrations and prevailing currents in the area Stull and Baird, 1985 and Stull et al., 1986. Samples were collected using a large bore (12.5 cm diameter) coring device (Bascom et al., 1982), which was dropped and recovered by hydraulic winch from the CSDLAC research vessel. After the sediment core was obtained, the device was hoisted to the ship. The core, contained in a thin plastic liner, was immediately removed from the sampler and packed in ice for transportation to the laboratory.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Map of White’s Point outfall.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Pesticides in Sediments From Queensland Irrigation Channels and Drains </title>
	<fulltext><segment>Sediment can be an important sink for persistent organic pollutants including many pesticides in present and past uses. Analytical results from sediments have been used to evaluate pollutant sources (Eitzer, 1993), historical trends (Jones et al., 1992) and to predict water and thus exposure concentrations of biota in the aquatic environment Mackay, 1991 and Connell, 1990.</segment><segment>Australia’s north-eastern state, Queensland, is located in a subtropical to tropical region and has a relatively low population density when compared to other industrialized countries. Agriculture is one of the State’s most important industries and is dominated by sugarcane and cotton cultivation which to date rely on intensive plant protection using pesticides. Depending on the physical-chemical properties of the compounds, local properties of the soil, topographical parameters and the climate, a fraction of the applied pesticide is transported into the irrigation drains and ultimately downstream into the marine environment and into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP).</segment><segment>The channels and drains in irrigation areas are subject to periodical desilting in which accumulated sediment and associated contaminants from the irrigation channels and drains are dug out and deposited along the banks of the water channel. The results presented here are part of a study which focussed on pesticide contamination in the desilted sediments including the potential for accumulation in grazing cattle.</segment><segment>The sediments were collected from 11 irrigation areas in Queensland (Fig. 1). The regions can be differentiated into those which are dominated by either sugarcane or cotton cultivation. In some regions, samples were collected almost exclusively from irrigation drains, whereas in other regions only supply channels exist and were sampled (Table 1). The majority of samples originated from either the Emerald irrigation area which is dominated by cotton cultivation (26 samples) or the Burdekin irrigation area (BRIA) dominated by sugarcane production (21 samples).</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Map of Queensland showing the capital city, the major cotton and sugarcane cultivation areas and sampling regions where sediments were obtained for analysis in this study.

	<title>Research, Extension and Industry – Working Together Can Achieve Results </title>
	<fulltext><segment>sustainable agriculture; land use impacts; sugarcane; Great Barrier Reef; Queensland, Australia; extension; rural change</segment><segment>As our communities place greater value on our natural environment, the expectations for good environmental management rise. As a result, considerable research investment is made in ascertaining the scale of impacts on natural resources, including Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Land uses and natural processes within surrounding catchments must be understood to be able to assess the condition of and manage impacts on marine, estuarine and riverine environments. Urban, industrial, agricultural and mining interests are all found alongside large areas of national parks and state forests in the catchments flowing to GBR. These land uses have altered the hydrology of the region and the loads of nutrients, sediments and other pollutants entering waterways (Hunter et al., 1996). At the same time, the landscape’s natural buffering systems such as riparian zones and wetlands have been reduced in area.</segment><segment>Papers in this volume were presented at a forum focussed on the sources and fate of pollutants in the GBR. Pollutants may enter the GBR lagoon through river discharges from the adjacent catchments – catchments which spread far inland. Runaway agricultural inputs have the potential to affect the GBR through elevated phosphorus inputs (weakening coral skeletons), accelerated algal growth from elevated nitrogen and phosphorus levels or through increased sediment loads which can smother corals, reduce light infiltration and prevent the settlement of coral larvae (Crossland et al., 1996). These pollutants may also impact on the GBR indirectly through their impacts on the health of the river and estuarine systems themselves and the implications for fisheries’ resources and habitats. Additionally, the development of natural ‘nutrient soaks’ in the landscape for urban and agricultural uses further exaggerates the problem.</segment><segment>If research is to be effective in achieving good environmental management, and thus reducing impacts on the GBR, it must not only identify where pollutants come from and what their impacts are but it must also aid stakeholders to better understand and manage their impacts. Recognizing this need, many fund providers now demand that ‘technology transfer’ components be incorporated into research activities. Is this occurring? If so, is it effective?</segment><segment>A number of different approaches may be used to bridge the gap between research and on-ground change. While different approaches are suitable in different situations, the challenge is equally as important in urban areas as it is in agricultural areas. This paper outlines some of the approaches made in the Australian sugar industry to ensure research activities achieve on-ground change. Research and extension providers can work more effectively together with industry to address environmental management issues.</segment><segment>Sugarcane is grown along a narrow coastal strip of eastern Australia stretching from Grafton in northern NSW (30°S) north some 2100 km to Mossman in Far North Queensland (16.4°S, 145.4°E). Sugarcane growing has also recently commenced in the Ord River irrigation area of northern Western Australia. The variation in climate, soils and social pressures across the industry is wide. Farms between Cardwell and Cairns experience the wettest climate in Australia (an average annual rainfall of 4048 mm yr−1 in Tully) while farms in Wide Bay Burnett and in the Burdekin receive in the order of 1100 mm rainfall/yr. As a result, irrigation water is applied in some regions whilst good drainage is critical in others.</segment><segment>Sugarcane production has been a part of the settlement of coastal Queensland and northern New South Wales for over 120 years. Today, almost 7000 farming partnerships supply 5.5 million tonnes of cane to 29 mills. Many of these farms remain as family enterprises. Cane farms vary in size, generally between 30 and 250 ha with a total of approximately 500 000 ha of land assigned for cane growing.</segment><segment>The industry’s location along a narrow coastal strip between two World Heritage areas (Wet Tropics and the GBR) place it under considerable pressure to adopt farming practices to minimize impacts on the surrounding environment. The practical implementation of research is critical. Members of the industry recognize that the long-term viability of these farming enterprises is dependent on the sustainable use of available soil and water resources. The industry has expressed a strong commitment to sustainable production (Vision 2000, 1995). Industry-sponsored organizations are endeavouring to provide the information, methods and tools to continually improve environmental performance.</segment><segment>Environmental challenges facing the sugar industry can be broken into two major groups – the sustainable management of existing farms and the careful expansion for new cane lands. Informed natural resource policy and planning processes are needed to reduce the impacts of expansion (Johnson et al., 1998). This paper focuses predominantly on extension processes directed towards management practices on existing farms.</segment><segment>Research and Extension for Rural Sustainability</segment><segment>Research and extension efforts in the agricultural sector have traditionally focussed on farm productivity. Today, research, extension and industry groups are placing more emphasis on improving the sustainability of farming systems. These approaches aim to balance production, environmental and social objectives. With this shift in focus, research, development and extension (R,D&amp;E) methods must be reviewed. It has been shown that the traditional extension techniques used for the promotion of productivity initiatives may not be the most appropriate mode for delivery of sustainability advice (Vanclay and Lawrence, 1995).</segment><segment>Traditionally, extension has been recognized as the process that begins when research results become available, a form of delivery to the end user. There are many examples of the effectiveness of this ‘linear’ technology transfer model in agricultural settings (Jiggins, 1993). This model resulted in quite rapid adoption of some technologies and in some cases is a suitable method. However, there are also many examples where linear extension models have been ineffective in dealing with issues of whole farm sustainability and off-site impact for a range of reasons (Vanclay and Lawrence, 1995). Extension is shifting from service delivery and education to a more result-oriented approach, moving from ‘technology transfer’ to ‘issues management’ (Patton, 1993).</segment><segment>Different extension models are needed to address different issues. For example, a new sugarcane variety which has been proven to be higher yielding, with higher sugar levels and suitable to the district will be tested relatively quickly following a simple linear extension model. Though even within the plant breeding programme there is some degree of grower involvement, natural resource issues are generally more complex and have less tangible benefits, requiring a varied extension method working with stakeholders to develop solutions.</segment><segment>There remains a need for rigorous research to be carried out to underpin the participatory programmes. It may be that some highly technical research is best done without farmer involvement. In these cases, further programmes are needed so that research findings can be converted into practice. Participatory and non-participatory research activities can be complementary.</segment><segment>If issues of environmental care are to be addressed effectively, researchers can no longer simply carry out research in isolation and leave it to extension agents to ensure that it will be adopted. More collaborative approaches are needed. To address this need, some researchers are becoming multi-skilled communicators, willing to challenge traditional research protocols in order to assist stakeholders find practical solutions. What they are finding is that decisions are not made purely on the basis of technical information from agronomic research trials.</segment><segment>The need for multi-disciplinary research is now well accepted in many circles, yet to be effective it must overcome some fundamental hurdles. Individual disciplines have evolved diverse perspectives and methods in research (Patton, 1990). The traditional focus on single areas of research can create difficulties when these disciplines attempt to work closely together.</segment><segment>King (1998) suggests that R,D&amp;E agents can in fact learn much from farmers about multi-disciplinary decision making. Farmers are constantly making decisions that take into account physical, environmental, technical, economic and social aspects. In the continual learning environment of farm management, sustainability can be regarded as a process of continual improvement, balancing all of these aspects. R,D&amp;E approaches which draw on both farmer knowledge and research knowledge to learn together will be better able to address all of these aspects of sustainability and lead to better farm practice.</segment><segment>Research and Extension in the Sugar Industry</segment><segment>From the early beginnings, the sugar industry has invested considerably in research, development and extension. As with most industries, R,D&amp;E has in the past focussed on enhancing productivity. Recent years have seen the profile of sustainability issues raised considerably. Several R,D&amp;E providers work with the industry.</segment><segment>The Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations (BSES) was established in 1900 as the principal provider of research, development and extension for the productivity, profitability and sustainability of the Australian sugar industry.</segment><segment>Cane Protection and Productivity Boards (CPPBs), managed locally by elected growers, provide an intensive extension service to growers, with a particular focus on pest and disease identification and management. More recently they have also included broader productivity issues such as plant nutrition. Sustainability is now also a part of their charter.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>North and South Carolina Coasts </title>
	<fulltext><segment>This region includes the diverse collection of estuaries along the North and South Carolina coasts, and the continental shelf waters eastward to the Gulf Stream (Fig. 1), located approximately 76°W, 36°30′N in the north, to 80°42′W, 32°17′N in the south. This coastal region is a gently sloping plain, containing riverine estuaries, sounds, lagoons, and salt marshes. Most of it is bordered by barrier islands formed within the past 15 000 years during sea level rise, and these islands play a major role in hydrological and biological estuarine processes. From the barrier islands, the continental shelf gradually deepens to approximately 50–60 m at the shelf break. The shelf is largely a soft-bottom system consisting of shallow (≪1 m) relict sediments (primarily fine, medium and coarse sands with varying amounts of calcareous sands) overlying a series of sedimentary/calcareous lithofacies, which outcrop to form rock-reef structures with up to 5 m relief. These hard-bottom outcrops, sometimes termed `live bottoms&apos;, support benthic algae and invertebrate communities with a variety of associated fishes (Cahoon et al., 1990a).</segment><segment>Fig. 1. The North and South Carolina coastal areas, south-eastern United States.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>From the shelf break seaward there is a rapid deepening, from approximately 50 km seaward of the capes, to about 100 km seaward from bays (Fig. 1). The position of the Gulf Stream roughly marks the shelf break, but this current is highly dynamic. Frictional forcing by the Gulf Stream drives the predominantly counter-clockwise circulation in bays, especially Raleigh, Onslow, and Long Bays. Filaments of offshore water sometimes move inshore along the south side of the shoals seaward of Cape Lookout and Cape Fear. Topographic features such as the `Charleston Bump&apos;, a rise in the continental slope off Charleston, and wind forcing drive Gulf Stream meanders up to 30–40 km seaward of the shelf break or onto the shelf itself (Pietrafesa et al., 1985). Intrusions typically reach the mid-shelf, but may reach 10 km from the shore (Atkinson et al., 1980). Meanders are also associated with shelf-edge upwelling, which can advect nutrient-enriched slope water on to the shelf. Upwelled nutrients are a significant portion of total new nutrients entering the shelf ecosystem (Atkinson, 1985). Wind forcing, particularly winds associated with storms, can drive significant flows shoreward (Pietrafesa and Janowitz, 1988).</segment><segment>The most striking feature along this coast is the large, enclosed sound known as the Albemarle–Pamlico Estuarine System (APES) (Fig. 1). Covering an area of approximately 7530 km2, this is the second largest estuary by surface area in the United States. This system is bounded by the Outer Banks of North Carolina, a series of heavily utilized barrier islands. The Chowan, Roanoke and other rivers feed the northernmost part, the oligohaline Albemarle Sound. The APES is constricted at Roanoke Island and widens to the south into the polyhaline Pamlico Sound which is fed by the Pamlico and the Neuse. South of the APES lies a series of narrow euhaline sounds between the mainland and barrier islands. The most significant estuaries in southern North Carolina are the lagoons that form the New River Estuary, and 65 km to the south of that system lies the Cape Fear Estuary, which drains the largest watershed in North Carolina. This is not constrained by barrier islands. Throughout the North Carolina coastline are numerous tidal estuaries ranging from 1 to 10 km in length.</segment><segment>Rivers originating in the piedmont feed most of the large estuaries in North Carolina. Exceptions are the New River, and the Black and Northeast Cape Fear Rivers, which are blackwater coastal plain rivers. Piedmont soils are largely clays that are reactive and bind with potential pollutants; thus, erosion and sedimentation in the piedmont can affect coastal water quality. Coastal Plain soils are generally less reactive and sandier, but the waters draining swamps here are darkly stained by dissolved organic matter.</segment><segment>In northern South Carolina, the largest estuary is Winyah Bay, fed by the blackwater Waccamaw and Black Rivers and the piedmont-derived PeeDee River. Adjoining it is North Inlet, a salt marsh estuary consisting of a maze of high salinity tidal creeks. To the south lie the North and South Santee River Estuaries, which have drainages arising in the piedmont. The principal urbanized estuarine system in South Carolina is the Charleston Harbor area, fed by the coastal plain-derived Ashley and Wando Rivers, and the piedmont-derived Cooper River. Just to the south lie the lowland Stono River Estuary, and the Edisto River Estuary which receives some drainage from the piedmont. Further south still lie St Helena Sound and the Broad River Estuary, which contain numerous tidal creeks, islands, and salt marshes. In contrast to North Carolina, most of the large estuaries in South Carolina are open to the ocean.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Pesticide and Herbicide Residues in Sediments and Seagrasses from the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area and Queensland Coast </title>
	<fulltext><segment>agricultural pollution; Great Barrier Reef; herbicides; pesticides; seagrass; sediment pollution</segment><segment>Persistent organochlorine compounds such as PCBs, DDTs and HCHs are ubiquitous environmental pollutants in the global ecosystem Loganathan and Kannan, 1991 and Voldner and Li, 1995 and were produced and used extensively in Australia until the late 1980s (Kannan et al., 1994). Compounds including lindane (γ-HCH), aldrin, heptachlor, chlordane, DDT and dieldrin were used extensively in Queensland agricultural applications (sugarcane, banana and dairying) for the control of insects and weeds Hamdorf, 1992 and Von Westernhagen and Klumpp, 1995 and for a wide range of domestic, public health and agricultural purposes in urban areas (Mortimer, 1998). As a consequence, these pollutants have been detected as contaminants in northern Australian groundwaters (Brodie et al., 1984), seawater Tanabe et al., 1982 and Kurtz and Atlas, 1990, freshwater biota Thomson and Davie, 1974 and Russell et al., 1996a, freshwater and estuarine sediments Dyall and Johns, 1985 and Mortimer, 1998 and marine biota McCloskey and Duebert, 1972, Olafson, 1978, Hamdorf, 1992, Von Westernhagen and Klumpp, 1995, Kannan et al., 1995 and Moss and Mortimer, 1996. Seafoods for human consumption collected along the tropical north-eastern Australian seaboard have also been shown to be contaminated with low levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, DDT and its metabolites, chlordane compounds and lindane isomers (Kannan et al., 1994).</segment><segment>Although most organochlorine pesticides were banned for use in Queensland in the late 1980s, large quantities of farm chemicals including organochlorines in liquid formulation are still held on farming properties in Queensland (McGuffog et al., 1996). It is estimated that at least 26 t of unwanted chlorinated pesticides (including DDT, endrin and lindane) are stored on farming properties in Queensland (McGuffog et al., 1996). Over 50% of these are located in catchments adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef. In addition, a number of triazine (atrazine) and organochlorine and phenylurea herbicides (diuron and 2,4-D) and organophosphate pesticides (chlorpyrifos) are still in wide use by the Queensland sugarcane industry (Hamilton and Haydon, 1996). Sugarcane production is the largest intensive agricultural industry carried out in Queensland and industry sales generated approximately AUS $1.2 billion in 1991 (Anon., 1992). The industry is situated primarily along the coastal fringe and is concentrated in northern Queensland, between Gladstone and Cairns. The persistent nature of many pesticides together with possible continued illegal use of banned organochlorine compounds raises the potential for continued long-term chronic exposure to plants and animals, including mangroves, seagrasses and corals of the Great Barrier Reef. The data presented here represent the first survey of contemporary concentrations of organochlorine pollutants in marine sediment and seagrass samples collected along the Great Barrier Reef and greater Queensland coastline.</segment><segment>Sediment and seagrass samples were collected from 16 Queensland intertidal (&lt;1 m deep) sites located between Cape York and Moreton Bay during February and May 1997 (Fig. 1). All sampling locations (with the exception of Cairns and Low Isles) are in the vicinity of important habitat of the dugong (Dugong dugon), a seagrass grazing marine mammal that has become endangered or exterminated over much of its range Marsh and Saalfeld, 1989, Marsh and Saalfeld, 1990, Preen, 1993, Marsh et al., 1995 and Marsh and Corkeron, 1997. Three replicate 2 l sediment samples and three replicate 2 l quantities of seagrass were collected from each sampling location. All samples were collected in solvent-washed glass containers. Each sediment sample was a composite of multiple surficial sediment samples collected randomly over an area of approximately 400 m2. A random sample of the dominant seagrass (Cymodocea serrulata, Halodule uninervis or Zostera capricorni) was also collected over the same area. Entire plants (leaves, roots and rhizomes) were sampled. Sediment and seagrass samples were frozen following collection.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Sediment and seagrass sampling sites: 1.

All sampling sites were located in shallow (typically &lt;5 m) water in major estuaries and northward facing bays along the northern and central Queensland coast. Two replicate 2 l sediment samples were collected from each sampling location. Each replicate sample was composited from 3 random grab samples collected from bottom sediments using a modified Van-Veen grab sampler. Replicate samples were collected approximately 500–1000 m apart. All samples were collected in solvent-washed glass containers. Sediment samples were frozen following collection.</segment><segment>Analyses of sediment and seagrass samples for pesticide residues and PCBs</segment><segment>Sediment and seagrass samples were analysed at the NATA-certified pesticide laboratory of Queensland Health Scientific Services, Brisbane, using routine laboratory methods with a series of QC/QA procedures. For the majority of compounds, which included aldrin, atrazine, chlorpyrifos, endosulfan (α, β and endosulfan sulfate), dieldrin, DDTs (pp-DDD, pp-DDE and pp-DDT), diuron, hexachlorobenzene, heptachlor, heptachlorepoxide, lindane and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), aliquots were extracted using acetone/n-hexane (1:1). The extracts were centrifuged and the supernatant was subject to repeated liquid/liquid partitioning with dichloromethane. The combined fractions of dichloromethane containing the compounds of interest were concentrated, transferred into n-hexane and made up to a volume of 3 ml. One ml of the extract was set aside for analysis of diuron and atrazine, while the second fraction of 2 ml (67% of extract) was subject to a clean-up on Florisil™ (5% deactivated with H2O). Compounds of interest were eluted in two separate fractions using n-hexane/diethylether (94/6 v/v) followed by n-hexane/acetone (90/10 v/v).</segment></fulltext>

	<title>The Bahamas </title>
	<fulltext><segment>The Bahama Islands are an archipelago in the tropical West Atlantic north of the Greater Antilles and south-east of Florida. Covering an area of 13 860 km2, with a total land and sea area of approximately 300 000 km2, the Bahamas consist of over 3000 low-lying carbonate islands, cays and rocks. The island territory extends from Grand Bahama on the Little Bahama Bank at 27.5°N, 1126 km south-east to Great Inagua (20°N), just north of Haiti (Fig. 1).</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Map of the commonwealth of the Bahamas.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>The northern and central islands are located on two vast carbonate platforms averaging 10 m in depth. The Little Bahamas Bank is located in the northern Bahamas while the Great Bahamas Bank begins approximately 100 km south, extending to the south and south-east. These Banks are separated by the North-west and North-east Providence Channels and the Great Bahama Bank is split by two deep water channels. The first of these channels is the Tongue of the Ocean (approximately 1500–1800 m deep), which separates Andros Island from New Providence and the Exuma Cays. The second is the Exuma Sound, similar in depth to the Tongue of the Ocean and forming a deep area to the east of the Exumas.</segment><segment>Beyond the central Bahamas, to the south-east, the islands are located on a series of carbonate platforms beyond which the island territory of the Turks and Caicos begins.</segment><segment>The Cay Sal Bank is located approximately 50 km west of the Great Bahama Bank and covers an area of nearly 4000 km2. Most of this bank is submerged beneath waters averaging 12 m in depth. A number of small islands, cays and rocks are scattered along the north, east and west margins of the Bank.</segment><segment>The Bahama Banks are isolated from neighbouring land on all sides, from the US by the Florida Straits, to the North by the Atlantic Ocean; from Cuba in the south by the Old Bahama Channel and to the east by deep water between Mayaguana Island and Great Inagua, beyond where the Caicos Bank begins.</segment><segment>The geological origin of the Bahamas Archipelago has been debated since Nelson 1853, when it was proposed that the Bahamas platform was a huge delta formed by the Gulf Stream as it met the Atlantic Ocean. The Bahamas began to develop around 200 million years ago, during the formation of the Atlantic Ocean. Later hypotheses on the formation of the Bahamas suggest that tectonic activity formed the deep channels and banks as grabens and horsts (Mullins and Lynts, 1977). Dietz et al. (1970) suggested that the channels and banks are the result of long-term depositional processes where carbonate production kept pace with subsidence and turbidity currents eroded the carbonate mass forming deep channels. Other schools of thought suggest the existence of a `megabank&apos; which included Florida, northern Cuba, the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Blake Plateau to the north. Around 80 million years ago this megabank was altered substantially by an event, perhaps the creation of the Gulf of Mexico (Sealey, 1994). This led to flooding of the Blake Plateau (now at 900 m depth), the separation of the Bahamas from Cuba and Florida, the creation of small banks separated by deep water in the south-east and the creation of the troughs and channels within and between the Little and Great Bahama Banks.</segment><segment>It is generally accepted that the Bahama Banks developed in an area conducive to hermatypic activity and that skeletal remains were deposited as sediments. In addition, oolitic sediment precipitated from the oceanic waters of the Atlantic as these moved on to the warm shallow banks. Drill holes have indicated that carbonate deposits making up the platform reach depths of over 5.4 km (Meyerhoff and Hattin, 1974).</segment><segment>The islands of the Bahamas formed when the platform became exposed during sea level lowstands caused by four major glacial events during the Pleistocene (Fig. 2)(Sealey, 1994). Sea level dropped as much as 120 m, exposing the Bank sediments. Fine, light rounded oolitic limestone was then blown by the trade winds to form dunes, which became lithified after flooding. During the interglacial periods sea level rose approximately 5–6 m above present-day sea level; fossil reefs throughout the Bahamas have been used to date sea level change (White et al., 1997). Erosional features are now common throughout the islands and the limestone rock has been weathered into karst formations such as caves, sink holes and solution pits (Gerace et al., 1998). The limestone is very porous and permeated by subterranean conduits formed by rainwater. Consequently, rainwater is diverted underground; there are no rivers and very little freshwater run-off from the islands except during the heaviest of rains. For a more detailed account on the geology of the Bahamas (see Carew and Mylroie, 1997).</segment><segment>Fig. 2. The islands of the Bahamas are low-lying limestone structures, typically located on the northern and eastern margins of large shallow water banks. From the air the influence of currents on the bank sands can be seen in features such as channels and large sand ripples (photograph Matthew Robinson).Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>Much biota existing in the Bahamas today is of Caribbean origin and was introduced during the last glacial advance when sea level dropped almost 100 m. This facilitated the movement of plants and animals across the much reduced oceanic gap between the southern Bahamas, Cuba and Hispaniola.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>The North Sea </title>
	<fulltext><segment>The North Sea, as defined by the North Sea Task Force, includes the area south of 62°N (NSTF, 1994), the Scandinavian Straits (the Skagerrak and the Kattegat) and the English Channel. This paper concentrates on the region north of the narrowest constriction near Dover (Fig. 1).</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Map of the Greater North Sea, the Skagerrak and the Kattegat, and the Channel, with bathymetry in metres (source: NSTF, 1994) and general circulation (after Turrell et al., 1992). Amphidromic points are also shown.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>The large, semi-enclosed, epi-continental North Sea (750 000 km2, 94 000 km3), has a mean depth of 90 m. It is a typical LME, but opens broadly to the Atlantic, and receives low-salinity water from the Baltic through the Kattegat and the Skagerrak, as well as from rivers. An important part is the Wadden Sea whose area covers just 1% of the total, about half of which are tidal flats. These are important production and nursery areas.</segment><segment>The North Sea is one of only a few major marine ecosystems to have been formed by flooding through the Holocene. The basin is shallow, deepening to the north, and is now heavily sedimented. Its western and northern coasts contain a variety of rocky and mountainous shores, sandy beaches, estuaries, and fjords, while the British east coast is bordered by cliffs, at places protected by pebbles, with a diversity of geological landscapes. On the eastern side, sand beaches and dunes prevail. The Wadden Sea offers large intertidal areas contained behind a girdle of barrier islands (Nienhuis, 1996).</segment><segment>In terms of species, the sea is still being colonized via the Dover Strait and from around Scotland. The shallow southern part of the eastern coastline has been strongly impacted by development.</segment><segment>Seasonality and Natural Environmental Variables</segment><segment>Climate (see Backhaus, 1989, 1996; Damm et al., 1994) is strongly influenced by an inflow of oceanic water from the Atlantic and by prevailing westerly winds, producing both short-period variability from strong continental influences and longer-term and generally weaker oceanic influences. Predominantly south-west winds alternate with easterly winds. The shallow nature of the basin, especially in the south, produces vertical thermal stratification.</segment><segment>During the past two decades, the North Sea has experienced exceptional climatic conditions; the period before 1988 had a series of severe winters, followed by particularly mild winters, and accompanying these changes, high salinities and increased storminess were noted (Becker et al., 1997). These changes were driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation, a periodic change in pressure between Iceland and Portugal, which determines the strength of prevailing westerlies and ocean surface currents.</segment><segment>Warmer water enters through the Channel (Fig. 2), which means that temperature amplitudes of 8°C are found in the south, relative to 2°C in the north (Becker and Pauly, 1996). Salinity displays few variations in the open North Sea (35 ppt), though in the Scandinavian Straits may be 25 ppt and in the Wadden Sea usually lower than 30 ppt. Multi-year cycles of river discharges have been identified, with low salinities in the 1970s–1980s, and higher values in 1989–1995; reduced run-off leads to increased inflow of Atlantic water (Prandle et al., 1997). In future, increasing irrigation and abstraction of freshwater in the watershed may combine with effects of climate change to magnify changes already observed.</segment><segment>Fig. 2. Proportion and age of Atlantic water flowing into the North Sea (Reid et al., 1989). Arrows indicate the sources.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>Winds, mainly westerly, increase with distance from the coast. They are seasonal with high winds in spring. Winds were weaker in the 1960s than more recently (Coeling et al., 1996), a change which has affected water circulation, which in turn has increased cloudiness.</segment><segment>Tides are semi-diurnal Pugh, 1987 and Hardisty, 1990. The dominant lunar tide (M2) and solar tide (S2) are both sinusoidal. Tides mainly enter around the northern British coast but are then constrained by narrowing and shallowing of the sea. This results in three well-developed amphidromic points (see Fig. 1). Spring tidal currents increase southwards, reaching 2–4 m s−1 near the southern coasts. Interactions between amphidromic systems cause the tidal range along the Dutch coast to decrease northwards (from 3 to 1.25 m), and then increase again (to 2.5 m) along the Wadden Sea. Some large tidal estuaries and bays occur, which have important effects on the stability of the substrate.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Particle Dry Deposition to Water Surfaces: Processes and Consequences </title>
	<fulltext><segment>The exchange of momentum, energy and mass at the Earth’s surface plays a key role in climate, ecology and the human health. However, our understanding of the chemistry of our atmosphere and biosphere–atmosphere feedbacks is limited by uncertainties in spatial and temporal patterns of the emission and deposition of trace species. To understand biogeochemical cycles, anthropogenic impacts on those cycles, and potential system feedbacks as a result of modification of those cycles, it is necessary to understand and quantify surface–atmosphere exchanges.</segment><segment>Nutrient Fluxes and Aquatic Ecosystem Responses</segment><segment>Phytoplankton (surface water dwelling, single-celled algae capable of photosynthesis) play key roles in food chains in the oceans as well as uptake of carbon dioxide by the oceans (Paerl, 1995). The use of carbon dioxide in photosynthesis by phytoplankton to create carbohydrates and other organic compounds creates an air–sea gradient which in turn leads to greater dissolution of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (Bigg, 1996).</segment><segment>Most oceanic primary production by phytoplankton is not limited by sunlight (or carbon dioxide availability) but rather by availability of nutrients, particularly nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Nitrogen represents a fundamental building block of plant cells (Owens et al., 1992) and P is a critical component of DNA (Graneli et al., 1986). Although P may be the limiting nutrient for open waters (Jickells et al., 1990), there is considerable evidence that N is of primary concern in estuaries and coastal waters, where it is more commonly the limiting nutrient, particularly during the summer (Fisher and Oppenheimer, 1991). These waters may be of primary interest in terms of global primary productivity. Indeed Paerl (1995) suggests that ‘nitrogen-limited estuaries, shallow coastal and continental shelf waters account for nearly half the global oceanic primary production.’ Typically N is not supplied by atmospheric fixation by organisms but by absorption of nitrate (NO3−), nitrite (NO2−) and ammonium (NH4+) from ocean waters.</segment><segment>Different species of phytoplankton use different wavelengths of light for photosynthesis and hence are grouped into classes which are named by the colour of light least used by the algae (e.g., green algae tend not to absorb the green portion of the visible spectrum).</segment><segment>The term ‘algal bloom’ typically is applied to rapid increase in the concentration of phytoplankton over a short period of time and in an extensive geographic area. Plankton growth typically has a strong seasonal cycle determined by sunlight and nutrient availability (Parsons et al., 1984) culminating in spring ‘blooms’ during which phytoplankton growth rapidly increases resulting in a yellow–green colouration of the water. This ‘bloom’ subsequently declines due to depletion of nutrient concentrations and consumption by zooplankton. Some of the nutrients are recycled into the water column when bacteria decompose the remains of phytoplankton or other organisms in the food chain. However, due to stratification of the water column, nutrients may not reach a depth where they can be re-used by other phytoplankton. Subsequent blooms may occur in the summer and autumn which are dominated by dinoflagellates which tend to induce a red–brown tint to the water and in extreme situations lead to ‘red tides’ (Haumann, 1989).</segment><segment>Rivers and lakes with clear water and low biological productivity are described as oligotrophic, while those water systems rich in organisms and organic materials are eutrophic. In the broadest sense eutrophication describes increased nutrient levels and resulting biological productivity. Human activity can greatly accelerate eutrophication, and the resulting high biological productivity, often characterized by blooms of algae, increases in sediment accumulation and bacterial populations and hence water opacity, and in some cases depletion of dissolved oxygen during algal decomposition causing fish and shellfish to be suffocated Paerl, 1995 and Barth and Nielsen, 1989. Red tides have also been associated with loss of human life due to bioaccumulation of algal toxins when shellfish ingest the algae and are subsequently eaten by man. Although not all algal blooms are associated with toxic algae, and not all cause discolouration of water, studies have shown that the number of red-tide events has increased during recent decades, particularly in more populated coastal regions (Anderson, 1994). It is also clear that addition of N to surface waters, by fluvial or atmospheric pathways, can greatly influence phytoplankton productivity, and ultimately the carbon cycle, water quality and aquatic ecosystem health are also affected.</segment><segment>Nitrogen emissions to the atmosphere may have doubled relative to the ‘natural background’ due to anthropogenic activity (Vitousek et al., 1997), and are predicted to increase by a further 25% to over 50% in less developed regions by 2020 (Galloway et al., 1994). For example, ApSimon et al. (1987) report that ammonia emissions rose by more than 50% over Europe between 1950 and 1977, more than doubling in the Netherlands. It should be noted that although much research to date has focused on inorganic N fluxes to aquatic systems, dissolved organic N (DON) is a major component of the total N flux to water bodies. Cornell et al. (1995) suggested that DON represent over half the input of dissolved fixed N to oceans via fluvial pathways. DON has also been found to be a ubiquitous component of rain (even at remote locations), and is present in particle samples. For example, Scudlark et al. (1998) determined that over one-fifth of N in rainwater is present as DON. The origin of the DON is extremely varied and can contain contributions from urea, amino acids and proteins Mopper and Zika, 1987 and Cornell et al., 1995. The impact of DON on phytoplankton growth may be considerable, particularly in light of research that suggests that the majority of DON may be bioavailable (Cornell et al., 1995).</segment><segment>Many coastal environments are already exhibiting signs of eutrophication, and with projected increases in N emissions to the atmosphere, there is great potential for an enhanced role of atmospheric deposition in eutrophication problems in the 21st century. Indeed some researchers have suggested that atmospheric inputs of fixed N have shifted surface ocean waters in parts of the north Atlantic from N- to P-limited, although this remains a subject of considerable debate (Jickells et al., 1990). Here we focus on N deposition in terms of nutrient loads because P has no significant atmospheric sources. However, it is important to note that the atmosphere supplies not only nutrients such as N compounds to water systems, but also a myriad of other chemicals from heavy metals Mason et al., 1997 and Sweet et al., 1998 to persistent organo-chlorines and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (Hoff et al., 1996). Many of these are highly likely to be transferred in association with particles.</segment><segment>Particles are ubiquitous components of the Earth’s troposphere and are of interest in a number of current environmental issues because they can directly and indirectly (via cloud processes) modify climate and visibility by their interactions with radiation, have been linked to detrimental health impacts (including increased mortality associated with elevated respiration of fine particles) and, as is discussed here, they act as carriers of nutrients and toxins to ecosystems.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>The Indian Ocean Coast of Somalia </title>
	<fulltext><segment>Somalia is located on the Horn of Africa, with Djibouti to the north-west, Ethiopia to the west, Kenya to the south-west, the Indian Ocean to the east and the Gulf of Aden to the north (Fig. 1). It extends over 637 600 km2 and has the longest coastline (3025 km) in Africa with an estimated shelf area (depth 0–200 m) of 32 500 km2. The country is divided into four geographical regions: the northern coastal plain of Guban, which has a semi-arid terrain; the northern highlands which are rugged mountain ranges that rise from the Guban region and contain the country’s highest peak (2407 m); the Ogaden region which descends to the south from the highlands and consists of shallow plateau valleys, wadis and broken mountains; this region continues to the Mudug plain in central Somalia.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Coast of Somalia and its main physiographic features. The map shows Pliocene–Quaternary sedimentary cover, the extension of two Large Marine Ecosystems of the Somali coast (cross-hatches) and Arabian Sea (dotted shading), and the annual mean surface isotherms. The dashed part along the 100 m isobath encloses the area colonized by coral reefs. Sketches A and B show the January and July Somali current.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>Little is known of the recent geological history of this extensive coast. Some general geological and morphological information is available Stefanini, 1930, Stefanini, 1933 and Dainelli, 1943, as well as data on mineral composition (De Angelis, 1938). Clark (1954) provides numerous observations on the Quaternary raised coral reefs and associated sediments, and data on facies distribution are given by Carbone et al. (1984) and Carbone (1987).</segment><segment>Only few and fragmentary data exist on the northern part of the Somali Indian Ocean belt Stefanini, 1930, Stefanini, 1933 and Clark, 1954. The whole Somali coast of the Indian Ocean is part of the wider, shallow water ecosystem which encompasses the continental shelf of Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania, to form part of the Somali Current Large Marine Ecosystem Alexander, 1998 and Okemwa, 1998. The flat continental shelf supports a wide variety of coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass meadows, beaches and estuaries over an area of 700 000 km2 between Dar es Salaam and just north of Ras Hafun. This continental shelf is mostly narrow and poorly surveyed, and in some places there appears to be no shelf along straight stretches of the coast, suggesting a fault origin. Indentations of the coast are generally accompanied by a widening of the shelf and the presence of strings of islands.</segment><segment>The existence of coral reefs developed along the coastline was formerly reported by Darwin (1842), who received from Capt. Owen and Lieut. Boteler information of `a coral-reef extending four or five miles along the shore&apos; near Mogadishu, and of the `coast and islands formed of madrepore&apos; from the Juba river to Lamu. North of Mogadishu, there are either no coral reefs whatsoever or, if there are some, they are poorly developed Crossland, 1902 and Crossland, 1904. This is due to the presence of an ocean current, which brings deep cold water to the surface. Fringing reefs stretch from between 500 and 1500 m offshore from Adale to the Kenyan border; the only major break in this reef is off Mogadishu, where corals are limited to patch reefs scattered within seagrass beds. More recent data on the distribution of coral reefs and other marine coastal habitats are summarized by Sheppard and Wells (1988), while Carbone et al. (1994) summarize the coast south of Mogadishu, where the Bajuni barrier island lies, flourishing with coral reefs, and where there is a drowned fluvial net made up of three wide braided channels, bordered by tidal flats and mangrove thickets (Fig. 9).</segment></fulltext>

	<title>The Malacca Straits </title>
	<fulltext><segment>The Strait of Malacca is located between the east coast of Sumatra Island in Indonesia and the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, and is linked with the Strait of Singapore at its south-east end. The Strait of Malacca is bordered on the north-west by a line from Ujung Baka (5°40′N, 95°26′E), the north-west extremity of Sumatra, to Laem Phra Chao (7°45′N, 98°18′E), the south extremity of Ko Phukit Island, Thailand, and on the south-east by a line from Tahan (Mount) Datok (1°20′E, 104°20′N) and Tanjung Pergam (1°10′E, 104°20′N) Hamzah, 1997 and Shaw, 1973.</segment><segment>Three smaller straits are found within this waterway: the Bengkali Strait, located between the islands of Bengkali and Sumatra; the Rupat Strait, between Rupat and Sumatra; and the Johore Strait, situated between the southern tip of Peninsular Malaysia and the north coast of Singapore. Together, these five straits form part of an important international shipping route linking the Indian Ocean (via the Andaman Sea) to the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean, and are collectively referred to as the Malacca Straits or the Straits of Malacca (Fig. 1). The Malacca Straits are bordered by four littoral States, namely Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. However, the navigational channel passes through the territorial seas of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. For the purpose of this chapter, the littoral States shall be limited to the latter three only. Their length is around 600 nautical miles (nm), with the widest section (220 nm) near the north-west entrance, narrowing gradually to around 8 nm at the south-east entrance near the Riau Archipelago. The depth of the water is irregular, from 17 to 55 m.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Map of the Straits of Malacca.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>The West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia is dominated by coastal plains and basins formed by alluvial deposits. Sandy beaches are found in a few areas. The eastern islands of Sumatra, mainly the Riau Archipelago, are generally made of granitic and old sedimentary materials that are rich sources of tin and bauxite. The broad alluvial coastal plain of central Sumatra consists largely of thick deposits of sediments where Indonesia’s main deposits of oil and gas are located. Offshore, there is a mix of 241 islands, coral reefs, estuaries, deltas and lagoons.</segment><segment>Some 14 rivers in Sumatra drain into the Straits of Malacca, with an estimated annual discharge of &lt;1 K)&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: -5px; vertical-align: middle&quot; title=&quot;Full-size image (&lt;1 K)&quot; src=&quot;/sd/grey_pxl.gif&quot; data-inlimgeid=&quot;1-s2.0-S0025326X00001089-si1.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;1 K)&quot; title=&quot;Full-size image (&lt;1 K)&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0025326X00001089-si1.gif&quot;&gt;(Indra Jaya et al., 1998); another 12 major rivers enter from Malaysia, including the Perak River, which is the second largest (Chua et al., 1997). Singapore has around 40 smaller drainage basins.</segment><segment>In 1994, the population of the coastal states in the east coast of Sumatra was 10.9 million, a density of 135 per km2; that of the states in the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia was 13.2 million (MPP-EAS, 1999a). Within the peninsula, the population tends to concentrate in the major urban centres of Penang, Ipoh and Johore Bahru. This distribution can be attributed to the presence of rich natural resources which encouraged greater infrastructure development there. Singapore has an estimated population of 2.85 million, a population density of 4608 per km2(DESIPA, UN, 1995).</segment><segment>The coastal economy of these areas was mainly agricultural. In recent years, however, there has been a shift in employment patterns towards non-agricultural production and services. In 1990, for example, the agricultural labour force was 49.9% of the total, while the industrial and service sector was 50.1% of the labour force. In Singapore, only 0.2% are now employed in the agricultural and fisheries sectors.</segment><segment>The Malacca Straits have a tropical climate. They are strongly influenced by the north-east Monsoon which brings rain from December to February, and by the dry Southwest Monsoon from June to August. In the two inter-monsoon periods the weather becomes unpredictable.</segment><segment>The direction of the wind varies with the monsoon seasons. Strong squalls, locally known as `Sumatras&apos; can occur in any month. There is abundant rainfall, and torrential rains of short duration occur any time of the year. Visibility in the Straits is clear (10 km or more about 95% frequency and less than 1 km below 0.5% frequency) except during heavy rain and when haze occurs. More recently, however, visibility in the area has been affected by a regular occurrence of the haze (Hamzah, 1997).</segment><segment>Tides in the Straits are mainly semi-diurnal with a tidal range of 1.6–3.7 m depending on location. In certain localities along the East Coast of Sumatra, tidal range may reach 4–5 m due to sea-bottom conditions.</segment><segment>Currents follow the topographic configuration of the sea bottom. The flow of surface current is stronger during the north-east Monsoon when the dominant direction of the surface current is from the South China Sea to the Andaman Sea. Surface current also enters from the Andaman Sea but turns north-west off Pulau Penang and the Perak coast. There is an undercurrent flowing from the Andaman Sea towards the Straits during monsoon periods which causes a light upwelling near the One Fathom Bank (Uktolseya, 1988). Tidal currents in the open waters are generally weak, though stronger tidal currents occur in narrow parts and passages around Pulau Iyu Kecil. Wave strength is strongest during the north-east Monsoon.</segment><segment>Surface water temperature is warmer during the Southwest Monsoon, ranging from 28°C to 30°C, but drops 1–2°C during the north-east Monsoon.</segment><segment>Salinity is influenced by high rainfall and by the numerous rivers. Freshwater from the rivers is largely responsible for lowering the surface salinity, while the monsoons affect the annual salinity variation. Coastal salinity may range 6.8–31.66 ppt off Malaysia, much more than off Singapore where it is 29–32 ppt (Din et al., 1996). In open water, surface salinity ranges from 30.80 to 31.83 ppt, which is similar to bottom values.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>By-Catch: Problems and Solutions </title>
	<fulltext><segment>The ecologist has never been asked before how to harvest an ecosystem optimally. In the mid 1950s, population dynamicists developed the quantitative models that have been the basis for 50 years of management. They were single-species models and, with many, the control mechanisms were simply the selection of optimum or minimum size to be taken. One of the early problems for gear technologists was to develop nets to fulfil these requirements. Selective fishing, as a concept, meant catching the desirable sizes of the target species.</segment><segment>More recently, the concept of selective fishing has changed, and its new meaning includes avoiding not only undesirable sizes of target species, but also avoiding forbidden species or those without economic value. If ecologists, rather than population dynamicists, had recommended a way to harvest an ecosystem, it would probably have resulted in a very different scheme. To concentrate all the impact of the harvest on a narrow range of sizes of one species seems, intuitively, a very unlikely way to preserve ecosystem structure and function (Hall, 1996). Economics and technology rather than ecological principles, have determined the way an ecosystem is exploited. Very selective fishing may be desirable in some cases but, from the ecological point of view, there is no experimental or theoretical evidence showing that this is the best, or the least harmful, way to extract a sustainable harvest from an ecosystem. The complexities of handling and processing the mixture of species and sizes, together with the lack of markets for many of the products, prevent the alternative (`non-selective&apos;) strategy of exploitation from happening. But this does not mean that things will never change. Sooner or later, the human species will have to give ecological principles a higher priority when choosing a foraging strategy.</segment><segment>Another area where ecologists and markets collide is in the choice of target species. If exploitation is targeted on a few species, the ecologist may recommend taking those at lower levels of the food chain on the grounds that fewer transfers between trophic levels should allow a much larger biomass harvest. However, markets in developed nations demand and pay a high price for swordfishes, tunas, sharks, and other top predators. Targeting these large species requires gear that frequently causes by-catches of other large and frequently long-lived species such as marine mammals, sea turtles, sea birds, and invertebrates. Purse-seines, gillnets, longlines and trawls take a toll of these groups Northridge, 1984, Northridge, 1991a, Magnuson et al., 1990, Brothers, 1991, Andrew and Pepperell, 1992, Stevens, 1992, Alverson et al., 1994, Bonfil, 1994, IWC, 1994, Jefferson and Curry, 1994, Wickens, 1995, Williams and Capdeville, 1996, Dayton et al., 1995, Alexander et al., 1997, Hall, 1998 and Vinther, 1999.</segment><segment>By-catches (Fig. 1) can create a conservation problem when endangered species are affected (i.e. the vaquita porpoise; Rojas-Bracho and Taylor, 1999), or when the level of take is not sustainable for the non-target species. They can affect biodiversity, and can disturb the ecosystem by transferring biomass between water layers (i.e. discards of bottom trawls on surface waters; Hill and Wassenberg, 1990), or by causing accumulations of biomass that affect the normal flow of nutrients and matter, may cause anoxia, or have other impacts on the benthos ICES, 1995 and Dayton et al., 1995. They may become a subsidy to those species that learn to utilize the fishing operations to find feeding opportunities at the expense of their competitors Furness et al., 1988, Wickens, 1995, Ramsay et al., 1997 and Laptikhovsky and Fetisov, 1999. On longer time scales, biomass discarded in deep water may not be recycled vertically, but may enter the circulation patterns of bottom water masses, that may take centuries to return its components to the ecosystem of origin. For decades, by-catches were mostly ignored by scientists working on stock assessment, by fisheries managers, and by environmentalists. There were several reasons for this neglect:</segment><segment>1.It was not visible. With most fisheries data being collected in ports, events happening at sea were not witnessed by scientists. There was ignorance on the existence or level of the problem. The by-catch issue became highly visible when the public found out about cases involving charismatic species such as dolphins (Perrin, 1968), or endangered species such as sea turtles (Magnuson et al., 1990).2.It was probably smaller in magnitude. The increase in scale of industrial fisheries has resulted in evolution of gear that covers huge volumes of water, moving in some cases at high speeds, and is much less selective. Examples of this are the transition of tuna fisheries from pole-and-line to purse seining, or from small coastal gillnets to large pelagic driftnets.3.It was less significant for stock assessment. With resources in earlier stages of exploitation, the waste of some of the target species was not perceived as a major factor affecting fishing mortality estimates. With fisheries closer to their upper limit, by-catches make a difference.4.The interference among fisheries was less intense. One of the main constituencies of the by-catch issue today are fishers affected by the waste of some gears or fleets. The more diversified the fisheries, and the higher the level of effort, the more intense is competition for the resources.5.The ecosystem concerns were not a management priority. The emphasis on single-species management models and schemes did not leave much room for consideration of by-catches.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Crew shovelling by-catch from the vessel deck (photo D.

By-catches of marine mammals, sea birds and sea turtles are a very significant if not dominant factor in the present management of some fisheries Alverson et al., 1994, Alverson and Hughes, 1996, Hall, 1996 and Hall, 1998. By-catches of fishes (i.e. halibut; Clark and Hare, 1998) or crustaceans (i.e. crabs) and other invertebrates in one fishery may cause or accelerate the closure of another.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>The Eastern Australian Region: a Dynamic Tropical/Temperate Biotone </title>
	<fulltext><segment>The eastern coast of Australia (from latitude 24°S to 37°S) lies in a overlap of the tropical Indo-Western Pacific and temperate bioregions, and therefore has a particularly rich biodiversity (Poore, 1996). The region, which adjoins the southern Great Barrier Reef in the north, includes the largest sand barrier islands in the world; large sheltered bays dominated by tropical seagrasses; coral reefs; open coastlines of long sandy beaches; river estuaries with well-developed wetlands; drowned river valleys; rocky shores; and coastal lakes dominated by temperate seagrasses. Offshore lie the highest latitude fringing and platform coral reefs in the world.</segment><segment>The coastal zone in this region includes the south-eastern part of the state of Queensland and all of the state of New South Wales (NSW). It supports around eight million people, almost half Australia’s population, and includes two state capitals (Brisbane and Sydney), as well as Australia’s major tourist and industrial centres. As a consequence, considerable pressures are placed on the region’s unique marine environment.</segment><segment>A proposed bioregionalization of Australia places this region in the Central Eastern Biotone, the warm temperate Central Eastern Province (shelf area 22 800 km2) and the northern part of the South-Eastern Biotone. The offshore reefs and islands are in the Norfolk province. The coastal bioregions are further separated into four meso-scale bioregions: Tweed–Moreton (the tropical/temperate overlap), Manning Shelf, Hawkesbury and Bateman’s Shelf (IMCRA, 1998). However, as this region includes separate state jurisdictions and many local districts, for the purposes of this chapter, the region has been divided into five geographic sectors: (a) South-East Queensland, (b) Northern NSW, (c) Central NSW; (d) Southern NSW and (e) Norfolk Island, Lord Howe Island and Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs (Fig. 1).</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Eastern Australia (South Eastern Queensland to NSW Victorian border) showing major coastal river catchments (italics) and urban areas. Insets (right): detail of Brisbane and Sydney metropolitan areas. The area is a tropical/tropical ecocline and has been divided into five sectors for this review: (A) Southeast Queensland; (B) Northern New South Wales; (C) Central New South Wales; (D) Southern New South Wales; (E) Norfolk region (offshore).Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>Seasonality, Currents and Natural Environmental Variables</segment><segment>As the region covers 13° of latitude and is a biogeographic ecotone, it has a range of climates and complex oceanography.</segment><segment>The climate in the northern sector is subtropical with hot summers, mainly summer–autumn rainfall (1400–2000 mm) and occasional cyclones. In the south, it is moist cool–temperate, with warm summers, but no seasonal pattern of rainfall (IMCRA, 1998).</segment><segment>The water masses in the region are largely South Pacific Central Water in origin. These are driven south-west by prevailing winds through the Coral Sea, where they are deflected southwards along the outer Great Barrier Reef and mainland coastline to become a moderately strong western boundary current, the East Australian Current (EAC) (Middleton, 1996).</segment><segment>The main stream of the EAC meanders and eddies southwards before finally separating from the coast, usually in the vicinity of Sugarloaf Point (300 km north of Sydney), although it may sometimes continue as far south as Ulladulla (400 km south of Sydney). Off Northern NSW, the EAC influences the continental shelf oceanographic circulation 90% of the time while the waters off Sydney are influenced 75% of the time (Ortiz and Burchmore, 1992). The EAC then turns easterly into the Tasman Sea towards New Zealand, forming a southern closure of the South Pacific subtropical gyre. Meanders of the EAC may form loops which can detach to form large eddies up to 300 km in diameter. Under the influence of strong southerly winds, the EAC may be accompanied by a northward counter-current, or even vanish completely (Burrage, 1993). As the EAC passes along the coast, it leads to the formation of even smaller-scale eddies and recirculation zones which are determined by the size and bathometry of headlands and coastal embayment. The direction of the current flow may be reversed due to northward flowing coastally trapped waves which originate in Bass Strait and southern NSW (Middleton, 1996). The current’s velocity is variable, depending on prevailing winds, but may flow at up to five knots (CSIRO, 1987).</segment><segment>Ocean temperatures are highly variable because of seasonal and short-term meandering of the EAC [Fig. 3(a,b)]. The annual range is around 20–28°C in the north (latitude 24°S) to 14–21°C in the south (latitude 37°S). The temperature difference between the EAC and surrounding waters may be over 5°C (Davis and Zann, unpub. data).</segment><segment>Fig. 3. The Eastern Australian Current brings warm tropical waters down the Eastern coast.

Upwellings of cooler shelf waters may occur, where the EAC separates from the coast (around Evans Head (29°17′S), bringing nutrient-rich waters onto the shelf (Davies and Zann unpubl. data).</segment><segment>The tidal range is 1–3 m and the wave clime is characterized by breakers 1.5–3.0 m in height. The northern sector experiences around 1.5 cyclones per year (IMCRA, 1998).</segment><segment>Temperature, rainfall, flooding and ocean circulation vary seasonally and year-to-year and are strongly influenced by El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. For example, during the very strong 1996–1997 ENSO, ocean temperatures exceeded 30°C in the north and 26°C off Northern NSW for several months. ENSO events also strongly influence rainfall and cyclones, and terrestrial runoff.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Marine Ecosystem Health as an Expression of Morbidity, Mortality and Disease Events </title>
	<fulltext><segment>Errors of Nature, Sports and Monsters correct the understanding in regard to ordinary things, and reveal general forms. For whoever knows the ways of nature will more easily notice her deviations; and, on the other hand, whoever knows her deviations will more accurately describe her ways. Francis Bacon (1620)</segment><segment>Red tides, bleaching of coral reefs, stranding of marine mammals, and mass mortalities of fish and invertebrates have been observed for millennia. Aristotle, Homer (Iliad), Tacitus, and early European navigators were astute observers of these episodic phenomena (Baden et al., 1995). This past century, the frequency, extent and duration of disturbances appear to be increasing HEED, 1998 and Harvell et al., 1999, but reports are fragmented.</segment><segment>Several groups have begun to characterize the health of entire coastal marine ecosystems GESAMP, 1990, NOAA, 1993 and NRC, 1999 and to understand the pressures upon them, compare management techniques and guide better studies. Institutions are now designing new monitoring programs to collect ecosystem health information. National and international `ecosystem health&apos; stewardship and conservation organizations have spent billions of dollars funding research and data collections relevant to ecosystem health questions, but global-scale marine ecosystem health information has not yet been consolidated (NRC, 1995). Thousands of researchers have however, published studies describing anomalies among various taxonomic and indicator responses to a wide range of global disturbances, so the potential exists to reassemble and characterize disturbance and impact information from published accounts and to reconstruct time series at a variety of scales to find common response patterns among multiple indicators.</segment><segment>Information technologies now allow `mining&apos; of bibliographic archives, geographic information systems, and Internet databases to re-collect scattered information. From observational accounts, patterns of some disturbance indicators appear to serve as proxies for each other in time. As collecting long time-series data for any single indicator is problematic (Magnuson, 1990), reconstruction of historical time series by scavenging available indicator and/or proxy data provides a new information base to evaluate large-scale and long-term disturbance patterns. The purpose of recovering disturbance records is to match impact `symptoms&apos; with exogenous factors. Epidemiologists use similar retrospective techniques to track public health problems. A marine epidemiological (marine ecosystem health) approach incorporates multiple techniques and the methods of many disciplines (Epstein, 1994).</segment><segment>The methods summarized here are a first-approximation data mining/data rescue effort to address both marine ecosystem health and disturbance questions. Methods rely upon a basic knowledge of species’ natural histories, as synchronized with, and/or responsive to ecological, climatic and oceanographic variability. From such an understanding, a large number of reported anomalous marine morbidity and mortality observations can be placed within an information system and grouped to represent a smaller number of disturbance indicators. Impact-based indices (grouping indicators by co-occurrence in time and space) are used to organize scattered and fragmented species monitoring data (Table 1). These indices measure multiple marine ecological disturbances (MMEDs) and are used to help define major impacts (Williams and Bunkley-Williams, 1992). The centralized MMED information provides more complete historical (e.g. time series) information than would be typically available to researchers or managers.</segment><segment>Table 1. Selection of disturbance observations (only occasionally reported) correlated with time-series measurements (regularly monitored) can provide rapid marine health and impact diagnostic information (from HEED, 1998). Fisheries economic and basic meteorological and oceanographic time series for defining impact conditions are required to establish anomalies (near continuous data). By locating and tracking significant `anomalies&apos;, determined by observation of threshold conditions and magnitude deviation from a place-specific average, correlative statistics can be run on the combined time series.Morbidity, mortality and disease reports.

Point data (x, y sample locale), river, estuary, harbour, bay, state, drainage basin, province, nation, large marine ecosystem and their subdivisions are the spatial scales researchers associate with marine indicators. Observers use temporal sampling increments of hours to decades, often reporting conceptual divisions of time such as peak, duration, phase, and seasonality (i.e. timing of phenological changes). Matching appropriately scaled data, many categories of data can be collapsed to fewer, either creating indices (for evenly sampled data time series) or general taxonomic functional classes for episodic observational data.</segment><segment>Episodic events involving 10 major taxonomic divisions and 10 regularly reported time-series data types within Table 1, are globally available and provide a first impression of co-occurring anomalies associated with scale relative functional impacts (Fig. 1(a) and (b)).

	<title>Eutrophication of Marine Waters: Effects on Benthic Microbial Communities </title>
	<fulltext><segment>Human population growth has drastically increased during the last century, and since coastal areas are intensively inhabited, pollution pressure on marine environments has been dramatically enhanced over this time. A broad, widely accepted definition of pollution has been given by the International Advisory Board of the United Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Pollution (GESAMP) as: `the introduction of substances or energy by man, directly or indirectly, into the marine environment (including estuaries) resulting in such deleterious effects as harm to living resources, hazards to human health, hindrance to marine activities including fisheries, impairment of quality for use of seawater and reduction of amenities&apos;.</segment><segment>Given this definition, a number of questions remain. Probably the most important problem is how to define (and measure) deleterious effects, which cover a broad spectrum of metabolic responses ranging from repairable disturbances of the normal metabolic pathways to the death of individual organisms or even populations. Besides direct effects on cells, the long-term effects on the behaviour and reproduction of organisms have to be considered as well. These problems demonstrate that a clear distinction between pollution and contamination (level of waste substrates exceeds the background level) is difficult. Taking into consideration the world-wide increase in concentrations of waste substances, what is the background level? Which concentrations of waste substances can be `tolerated&apos; by the biological communities, and which is the level of substances at which damaging effects are manifested? This certainly depends not only on the community structure and the physiology of the organisms, but also on the variety of environmental conditions and their interactions. Another difficult problem is to differentiate between effects on marine biological communities arising from pollution and those from natural changes in hydrographical or meteorological conditions. As has been shown many times, increasing concentrations of waste substances in combination with unusual weather conditions have led to catastrophic effects on marine biological communities.</segment><segment>The release of materials into the marine environment derives from both point and non-point sources. Dumping or discharges of industrial waters and municipal sewage sludges represent primary point-source pollutants. Non-point pollution originates from diffuse sources, such as urban and agricultural run-off, groundwater transport and atmospheric inputs by dry or wet deposition. Non-point pollution is widespread and spatially and temporally variable, occurring in all coastal waters. Although non-point run-off is significant, its contribution to marine pollution is difficult to quantify because of its diffusive character. Commonly occurring pollutants from land-based sources include excessive inorganic and organic nutrients, xenobiotic compounds including radioactive substances, metals, as well as pathogens and other infectious agents. Various aspects of the problems of marine pollution have been addressed by a number of comprehensive overviews Vollenweider et al., 1992, Sundbäck, 1994, Jørgensen and Richardson, 1996, Caumette et al., 1996, Kennish, 1997 and Smith, 1998.</segment><segment>The following focuses on effects of eutrophication on the marine environment. Special emphasis will be paid to the response of benthic microbial communities to excessive nutrients. In a case study, the effects of eutrophication on benthic microbial communities in shallow-water coastal inlets in the southern Baltic Sea will be demonstrated.</segment><segment>The discharge of excessive nutrients from municipal and industrial waste waters, urban and agricultural run-off leads to the enrichment of inorganic and organic material in marine waters. These inputs, resulting in eutrophication, present one of the major stresses to the marine environment. Eutrophication can be defined as the process by which increasing nutrients cause a change of the nutritional status of a given body of water (Richardson and Jørgensen, 1996). Most frequently, we mean the increase in the availability of mineral macronutrients (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus), although the supply of excessive decomposable organic carbon leads to eutrophication as well. Based on primary production, Nixon (1995) proposed four categories to describe the trophic status of marine coastal and estuarine ecosystems: oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic, and hypertrophic. The categories of increasing eutrophication are defined by increasing rates of primary production, ranging from less than 100 to more than 500 g carbon m−2 yr−1. Whereas, ocean waters can be regarded as oligotrophic, most marine coastal systems range from mesotrophic to eutrophic, because of anthropogenic and riverine inputs.</segment><segment>Eutrophication has become a serious problem in virtually all coastal waters around the world. The problem is enhanced in areas with restricted exchange of water. The observation of large areas of anoxia in bottom waters of nutrient-enriched regions of the Baltic Sea represents well-known examples Brügmann and Bachor, 1990, Nehring, 1992 and Rheinheimer, 1998. Characteristic of this sea is the stratification of the water column in a surface layer of lower salinity and bottom water of higher salinity. Since the halocline restricts the vertical exchange of water, deep basins of the Baltic Sea especially suffer from long periods of anoxia, because the exchange of water occurs only occasionally, depending on the hydrographical conditions via inflow of saline water from the North Sea. As pointed out by Stachowitsch (1992), eutrophication can be regarded as a contributing or enhancing factor which, together with adverse meteorological and hydrographical conditions, causes depletion of oxygen and subsequent mortality of benthic communities. Although it appears that developed countries have recognized the problem by developing strategies to reduce the nutrient burden, undeveloped countries seem to suppress the problem, almost totally relying on the dilution effect of exchange processes in marine waters. Worldwide, there are many other examples too. Low tidal exchange in parts of the Mediterranean, for example, has led to several embayments in which stratified deeper layers have become anoxic – much of the large Black Sea is a case in point – while in several other areas, man-made restrictions such as solid fill causeways connecting islands of atolls, for example, cause large areas to deteriorate much more rapidly than might otherwise have been the case.</segment><segment>Effects of Eutrophication on Marine Communities</segment><segment>The effects of eutrophication are obvious. With the availability of macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus), primary production by algae and macrophytes is stimulated. Subsequent decay of high plant biomass causes an increase in oxygen consumption which may lead to anoxic conditions in bottom waters and sediments, since the biological oxygen consumption exceeds the supply of oxygen by diffusion by orders of magnitude. With increasing eutrophication, the structure of phytoplankton communities changes, resulting in the unpredictable occurrence of novel algae blooms. Increased turbidity of the water column and oxygen depletion greatly influence benthic communities with changes in their distribution, abundance, diversity, and physiological state. Losses of submerged aquatic vegetation causes the sediment to become mobile. Benthic metabolic processes change from aerobic to anaerobic decomposition of organic matter, causing liberation of hydrogen sulphide into the bottom water. End products of the anaerobic decomposition processes cause additional oxygen demand. The problem of oxygen depletion is even enhanced by the stratification of the water column, especially in summer conditions.</segment><segment>Eutrophication leads to an increase in the availability of nitrogen and phosphorus. Since silica does not increase simultaneously, the ratio of nutrients is altered, thus influencing phytoplankton species composition and succession. Species of algae that do not require silica dominate; diatoms requiring silica are discriminated against. Alterations in the ratio of the macronutrients may be responsible for the occurrence of novel and toxic algae blooms. Since diatoms play a key role in pelagic and benthic assemblages – representing the basis of food webs – limited diatom growth has important impacts on the trophic structure and the cycles of nutrients in marine environments Conley et al., 1993 and Sundbäck, 1994. Changes in food web structures of benthic communities by eutrophication were found by Nilsson et al. (1991) and McClelland and Valiela (1998).</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Holistic Environmental Assessment and Offshore Oil Field Exploration and Production </title>
	<fulltext><segment>oil and gas; holistic environmental assessment; total environmental risk; impact pathways; environmental damage; public perception</segment><segment>Offshore oil and gas resources are important to the UK economy and have been for 25 years. 23 billion ‘barrels of oil equivalent’ (boe) has been produced from fields on the UK Continental Shelf since 1975, with an estimated 20 billion boe remaining. Oil and gas provide 69% of the UK’s energy needs (oil=36%, gas=33%) and contribute to some 2% of the UK’s Gross Domestic Product (Department of Trade and Industry, 1998a). UK oil field exploration and production occur in north-west European waters and these have been classified as a special area under MARPOL Annex 1 (Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions, 1998). Consequently, the activities of the offshore oil and gas industry occur in an environmentally sensitive region.</segment><segment>When oil was first produced offshore in the UK in 1975, oil and produced water discharges were regulated by the Prevention of Oil Pollution Act, 1971, and statutory controls were implemented by the Department of Energy. The UK law did not require Environmental Assessment (EA) for field developments. Today, EA is a statutory requirement and environmental regulation of the industry has broadened and become tougher. This is characterized by the recent implementation of the Offshore Petroleum Production and Pipelines (Assessment of Environmental Effects) Regulations 1999, The Offshore Combustion Installations (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Regulations 2000 and the changes in decommissioning policy under the Petroleum Act 1998. It appears that environmental regulation will continue to get tougher as more EU environmental Directives are implemented (Moore, 1999). Industry is also being held increasingly accountable for its operations through ‘soft law’ concepts such as the ‘precautionary principle’, ‘polluter pays’ and ‘producer responsibility’. Consequently, operators are publishing annual environmental reports to demonstrate to stakeholders their progress in improving environmental performance (Salter and Ford, 2000).</segment><segment>The industry is clearly therefore being closely controlled by legislation. However, the environmental performance of the UK offshore oil and gas industry in the twenty-first century is also being measured against a broader agenda based on corporate accountability and responsibility, and this appears to be becoming a core business issue. A 1999 advertisement by Shell stating its commitment to generate renewable energy for the public, confirms this:</segment><segment>`Ignoring alternative energy is no alternative. Keeping pace with the world’s accelerating demand for energy and supplying power to remote areas require Shell to pursue renewable resources like solar, biomass and wind energy. We established Shell International Renewables with US$500 million commitment to develop these new opportunities commercially. One of our goals is to make solar energy cheaper, more efficient and more accessible both for businesses and homes. It’s part of our commitment to sustainable development, balancing economic progress, with environmental care and social responsibility. So with real goals and investment, energy from the sun can be more than just a daydream&apos; (Shell International, 1999).</segment><segment>The change in the attitudes of the large oil and gas companies is demonstrated by their diversification into alternative sources of energy. Energy historians will remember 1997 as the year in which two of the world’s largest oil companies took a major step into the development of alternative sources of energy by announcing that they were making major investments in solar and wind energies. In this year, BPAmoco and Shell committed, respectively, US$1 billion and US$500 million to the development of wind, solar and other renewable energy resources. This highlighted the fact that the companies take the threat of global warming seriously and are metamorphosing into energy companies (Worldwatch Institute, 1998).</segment><segment>They will also remember the late 1990s as a period where Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth campaigned against the exploitation and burning of fossil fuels, particularly against oil exploration in the Atlantic, north-west of Scotland and BP’s Northstar and Liberty projects in the Beaufort Sea. Both groups were concerned that the agreements in the Kyoto Protocol are not being implemented effectively and that the science behind climate change was being brushed aside for short-term economic gain. The groups were attributing large-scale natural disasters to the activities of the industry:</segment><segment>`We in Bangladesh are experiencing the impacts of climate change first hand. Last year’s floods brought death and devastation to our country and people. We hold companies like Exxon and Mobil responsible&apos; (FOE, Bangladesh, 1999).</segment><segment>This paper highlights how environmental issues are increasingly being approached holistically and that this appears to be a reflection of an increased concern over environmental impacts and a fortification of the offshore environmental regulatory regime.</segment><segment>A Definition of Holistic Environmental Assessment</segment><segment>Holistic Environmental Assessment (HEA) is a goal orientated process that utilizes knowledge from all available sources and disciplines. It attempts to give an accurate account of the total environmental risk to society arising from all phases of a process designed for the manufacturing of a product and/or provision of service. It aims to ensure that, in a competitive global market, strategies to reduce pollution in a particular phase of a process do not lead to greater pollution in another.</segment><segment>HEA focuses on the qualification, quantification and prioritization of environmental impacts from activities in each phase of a chosen process. These impacts are represented as pathways and detail direct, secondary, indirect and cumulative environmental impacts. They are analysed in relation to other activities in a chosen geographical area to assess total environmental risk. Identification of impacts includes those that are both actual and perceived by society as warranting concern. Consequently, such pathways are chains of causality, initiated by a specific activity, that span environmental science, engineering, economics and law.</segment><segment>Conceptually, HEA, like nature, has few boundaries and in practice, simplifications will have to be introduced to ensure that an appropriate level of detail is assessed. HEA may be used either as a planning or comparative assessment tool. Consequently it will be useful to governments, industry and non-governmental organizations in their efforts to perform environmental analyses at a strategic level.

	<title>Evidence for the Effects of Metal Contamination on the Intertidal Macrobenthic Assemblages of the Fal Estuary </title>
	<fulltext><segment>estuarine comparisons; macrobenthos; pollution; metals; crustaceans; annelids</segment><segment>Due to extensive mining in the catchment area of the Fal estuarine system in the past, metal concentrations in the intertidal sediments are the highest in Britain (Bryan and Gibbs, 1983). A marked gradient of sediment metal concentrations has built up, and sediments in otherwise similar creeks in different parts of the system have levels of metals (including copper, zinc, arsenic, cadmium, iron) which differ by orders of magnitude Bryan and Gibbs, 1983, Somerfield et al., 1994a and Somerfield et al., 1994b. For this reason the Fal Estuary system has been the site for a number of studies on the effects of long-term heavy metal pollution on marine organisms (see Bryan and Gibbs, 1983; Bryan and Langston, 1992 for reviews). Metal levels have been elevated in the Fal for such a long period that events in the estuary cannot be viewed as simple pollution/recovery incidents, and the effects of heavy metal toxicity can be ameliorated by the induction of metal tolerance mechanisms in some species, and in others by the evolution of tolerant strains (Bryan and Langston, 1992). Nevertheless, recent surveys of the macrobenthic and meiobenthic communities of the intertidal flats of the Fal Estuary system have shown that, of all environmental variables measured, heavy metal concentrations in the sediments correlate most strongly with the composition of the biological communities and are therefore the most likely causal agents Somerfield et al., 1994a and Somerfield et al., 1994b. However, since the whole of the Fal system is historically contaminated with metals to some degree, it is not possible to determine what special features of the biology of the Fal as a whole might be attributable to metal contamination, and in this paper a wider formal comparison is made between the Fal biota and data from similar surveys of other comparable estuaries in south-west Britain. The intention of this paper is not to provide detailed accounts of the macrobenthos of the Fal or of other south-west estuaries, which are published individually elsewhere, but rather to undertake a meta-analysis of the most recent survey data from each estuary in order that the Fal can be viewed in context.</segment><segment>Based on sediment copper data in Bryan and Gibbs (1983), five creeks in the Fal estuarine system (Restronguet, Mylor, Pill, St Just in Roseland and Percuil) were sampled, to cover the expected range of heavy metal concentrations in the system Somerfield et al., 1994a and Somerfield et al., 1994b. The samples were collected in November 1991 and again in March 1992, before and after the much publicised overflow from the Wheal Jane mine (Somerfield et al., 1994b). Single sediment core samples of 20 cm diameter, to a depth of 20 cm, were taken from seven sites in Restronguet creek and five in the other four creeks (Fig. 1). The sediment was sieved on a 0.5 mm mesh and all the invertebrates retained were identified and counted. For the purposes of the present analysis the set of five (or seven) core samples from each creek has been combined as a single sample representative of that creek.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Map of the Fal estuary, showing the sampling locations in the five creeks.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>In 1987, the Plymouth Marine Laboratory undertook extensive surveys of macro-invertebrates at 40 estuarine intertidal flats in six other SW estuaries, each comparable in area to the five creeks studied in the Fal: the Tamar, Plym, Exe, Poole Harbour, Southampton Water and Severn (Warwick et al., 1991). Data on species composition from each area is derived from a grid of 15 sampling points, at each of which two 10 cm diameter core samples were taken for macrofaunal analysis, and sieved at 0.5 mm.</segment><segment>The species abundances, totalled for each creek in the Fal in both November 1991 and March 1992 have been aggregated to the same taxonomic levels and merged with the data from the other 40 south-west estuaries sites. The following statistical analyses have been undertaken:</segment><segment>(i) A triangular similarity matrix between every pair of locations was constructed using fourth-root transformed species abundance data and the Bray Curtis similarity measure. This matrix was then subjected to non-metric multi-dimensional scaling ordination (MDS) (Kruskal and Wish, 1978).(ii) A similarity percentage breakdown (SIMPER) (Clarke, 1993) was used to determine which species are responsible for differences in the average Bray Curtis similarity between the Fal sites and other estuaries. Essentially, this procedure computes the average dissimilarity between all pairs of inter-group (Fal vs the rest) locations, and then breaks this average down into the separate contributions from each species.(iii) K-dominance curves (Lambshead et al., 1983) were produced, averaged for each estuary, to examine differences in diversity profiles.</segment><segment>On the two-dimensional MDS plot (Fig. 2) the Severn Estuary sites are clearly distinct in species composition, and this has been attributed to the large size of the estuary and its highly physically dynamic nature (Warwick et al., 1991). For greater clarity of comparison with the other more typical estuaries, the analysis has therefore been repeated excluding the Severn sites (Fig. 3). From this plot it is clear that the Fal sites are distinct from the muddy sites in the other south-west estuaries, and these in turn are distinct from the sandy sites.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Box Coring Artifacts in Sediments Affected by a Waste Water Outfall </title>
	<fulltext><segment>The largest changes in porosity (i.e. the volume fraction of sediments occupied by water) in marine sediments occur in near-surface sediments. Porosity changes lead to changes in mechanical properties (e.g. strain) of the sediments, which can be the cause, among other things, of coring artifacts. Sediment porosity in coastal marine sediments is normally high at the surface, and decreases with depth. Generally, higher organic matter content causes, swelling of sediment particles and thus, a higher water content and porosity in that layer. In sediments that have received organic matter rich particles from ocean outfalls in the past, the layer with higher organic matter and water content is buried at depth. This high porosity layer in between layers of sediments of lower porosity and organic carbon (OC) content can create a layer of lower strain subject to loss of sediment during coring.</segment><segment>Any sediment loss, however, can lead to serious under-estimations of accumulation rates of sediments and pollutants. Since reported sedimentation rates, which allow the assessment of sediment-water exchange fluxes on the Palos Verdes (PV) shelf, range from fractions of cm/yr to several cm/yr (e.g. Eganhouse and Kaplan, 1988, Logan et al., 1989, Drake, 1994 and Swift et al., 1996, summarized in Paulsen et al., 1999, and Santschi et al., 2000a), and since the magnitude of sediment–water exchange fluxes of pollutants at this site is still disputed (e.g. Renner, 1998), potential coring artifacts in such sediments are of great interest.</segment><segment>Previous studies of PV sediments have shown sediment loss during gravity coring (Lee, 1994), but box coring has usually been deemed artifact-free (e.g. Lee, 1994, Huh et al., 1990, Huh et al., 1992, Wheatcroft and Martin, 1994 and Logan et al., 1989). Only when box cores are sampled repeatedly, and when the same parameters are used to test for reproducibility, is it possible to test if box coring is inherently more reliable. Here we report test results from two coring sites on the PV shelf near the Whites Point outfall.</segment><segment>One box core was collected from the PV shelf on 17–18 September 1997 from site 6C and one from site 8C. In addition, one vibra core was taken from site 6C. Individual sub-cores were collected sequentially from a box core for testing of possible coring artifacts. Sampling locations are shown in Fig. 1and listed in Table 1, along with other ancillary parameters. Sediment samples from sub-cores were processed for radiochemical determinations Paulsen et al., 1999 and Santschi et al., 2000a, elemental analysis including OC, total N (TN), total S (TS), and trace metals (Santschi et al., 2000b). Lengths of cores described in Santschi et al., 2000a and Santschi et al., 2000b were close (within 5–10%) to the nominal core depth of 60 cm and, thus, suffered only minimally from the coring artifact described in this paper.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Map of Palos Verdes shelf, showing sampling locations and positions of Whites Point outfall pipes.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>Table 1.

	<title>DDT, PAH and PCB in Sediments from the Intertidal Zone of the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea </title>
	<fulltext><segment>Yellow Sea; Bohai Sea; PCB; PAH; DDT; sediment</segment><segment>Since the early 1980s, the economic situation along the coastline of the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea has developed rapidly. People from inland cities and countryside have migrated to coastal cities, such as Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, Lianyungang and Shanghai to find work, causing the population to rise rapidly within the area. Large amounts of industrial and municipal effluents have entered the offshore environment causing the coastal environment to deteriorate seriously. Petroleum hydrocarbon in clams from Liaodong Bay has increased significantly since 1985 (Ma et al., 1999). Jinzhou Bay was heavily polluted by heavy metals because of zinc mining nearby (Liu et al., 1987 and Qiao, 1991). New pollutants such as PCB, PAH, etc., entered the marine environment and accumulated in shellfish (Liu et al., 1996). The authors of this paper made an investigation on the residue levels of the organic pollutants in sediments and organisms during October and November 1997. The status and the spatial trends of organic pollutants, PCB, PAH and DDT in intertidal zone sediments of the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea were also studied.</segment><segment>Twenty locations in the intertidal zone of the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea were determined for sediment collection (Fig. 1). Surfacial sediments (within 10 cm) were taken by hand using bamboo scoop at each site and stored in glass jars. The procedure used for sediment sampling was performed according to the specification of oceanographic survey (SOA, 1991). All sediment samples were stored frozen at −20°C until laboratory analysis.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Map showing sites where sediments were sampled in the intertidal zone of Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea.Figure optionsDownload full-size imageDownload as PowerPoint slide</segment><segment>After air drying, each sediment sample was ground with mortar and pestle and filtered by a sieve of 0.14 mm mesh. Twenty grams of dry and ground sediment was added to 60 ml of acetone (dichloromethane)/hexane (1:1, v/v) for 50 h. Then the samples were extracted three times by ultrasonic wave method, each time for 20 min, combining the extracted solutions. The acetone solvent in the sample extracts was replaced by 20% sodium sulphate solution (dichloromethane solvent was removed by rotating evaporator). The hexane extract was added to a 10 g Al2O3 column chromotography and then washed using 60 ml of dichloromethane/hexane (1:1, v/v). The solution was evaporated nearly to dryness to remove dichloromethane solvent and redissolved in 1.0 ml hexane. Sulphur in the extracts was removed with 1.0 g of Cu and by ultrasonic wave method. DDT and PCB were quantified using a GC-7A, equipped with an electron capture detector (ECD) at 350°C and PAH was quantified using a HP5989A (GC/MS). The quantification of the contaminants was based on external calibration curves and the relative standard deviation of the measurements was 5–10%. Calculations of residue concentrations were based on dry weight of samples.</segment><segment>Detection limits were 0.30 for PCBs, 0.10 for p,p′-DDE, 0.20 for p,p′-DDT, o,p′-DDT and p,p′-DDD, 2.0 for naphthalene, 1.0 for fluorene, 1.3 for phenanthrene, 1.1 for anthracene, 1.8 for fluoranthracene, 2.1 for pyrene, 5.0 for chrysene and benzo(a)anthracene and &lt;1 K)&quot; title=&quot;Full-size image (&lt;1 K)&quot; src=&quot;/sd/grey_pxl.gif&quot; data-inlimgeid=&quot;1-s2.0-S0025326X00001181-si3.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;1 K)&quot; title=&quot;Full-size image (&lt;1 K)&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0025326X00001181-si3.gif&quot;&gt; dry weight for benzo(a)pyrene and benzo(e)pyrene, respectively.</segment></fulltext>

	<title>Changes in Macroalgal Communities in the Vicinity of a Mediterranean Sewage Outfall After the Setting Up of a Treatment Plant </title>
	<fulltext><segment>Mediterranean; wastewater treatment; macroalgae; communities; changes; pollution</segment><segment>Wastewaters emanating from the urban area of Marseille (Mediterranean Sea, France), which represents 1.5 million inhabitants, have been discharged into the sea directly on the shoreline at Cortiou cove since 1886 (Fig. 1). In 1959, waters from two small coastal rivers (the Jarret and Huveaune), polluted by a variety of industries, were added to this discharge, at first only in summer, and subsequently year round since 1980. These industrial and domestic sewages were discharged into the marine environment without treatment for several decades. Changes to both the environment and benthic communities in this area were reported in a number of studies (Bellan-Santini, 1968, Arnoux and Bellan-Santini, 1972, Bellan and Bellan-Santini, 1972, Arnoux et al., 1973, Belsher, 1974, Belsher, 1979, Bellan et al., 1975, Leung Tack Kit, 1976, Romano, 1979, Romano, 1986, Bellan and Bourcier, 1984 and Bellan and Bourcier, 1990). In 1987, the setting up of a primary treatment plant for the whole sewage following a preceding treatment of industrial wastes, led to a significant decrease in the levels of pollution (Table 1). The sewage flowing into the sea is mainly carried westwards along the coast by currents and prevailing winds (Auclair-Dessemon, 1973). This transport process results in a dilution of the polluted waters and the establishment of a pollution gradient.</segment><segment>Fig. 1. Location of study area and sites.
